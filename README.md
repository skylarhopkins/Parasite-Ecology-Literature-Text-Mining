# Parasite-Ecology-Literature-Text-Mining
A quick project to see what terms are most commonly used in the titles and abstracts of 2017 "parasite ecology" literature.

#28 October: Performed WoK search for 2017 parasite ecology papers and built a word cloud

#28 October: Tried and failed to debug stemDocument and stemCompletion. Played w/ the word cloud until it was pretty.
