Abstract = {{Some wildlife species are capable of surviving in urbanised
   environments. However, the implications of urbanisation on wildlife
   health, and public health regarding zoonoses, are often unknown. Quenda
   (syn. southern brown bandicoots, Isoodon obesulus) survive in many areas
   of Perth, Australia, despite urbanisation. This study investigated
   differences in gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto-parasitic
   infections, morphometrics and reproductive status between bushland and
   urban dwelling quenda. 287 quenda in the greater Perth region were
   captured and sampled for faeces (to detect gastrointestinal parasites),
   blood (to detect Toxoplasma gondii antibodies), ectoparasites, and
   morphometrics. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic and
   linear regression. Most parasitic infections identified in quenda were
   of native parasite taxa that are either not known to, or considered
   highly unlikely to, infect humans or domestic animals. However, stick
   fast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) were present at low prevalences and
   intensities, and Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Amblyomma spp.
   infections require further investigation to clarify their
   anthropozoonotic significance. Quenda captured in urbanised environments
   had differing odds of or intensity of certain parasitic infections,
   compared to those in bushland - likely attributable to quenda population
   density, and in some cases the availability of other host species or
   anthropogenic sources of infection. Urbanised environments were
   associated with an increase in net weight of adult male quenda by 189.0
   g (95\% CI 68.6-309.5 g; p = 0.002; adjusted R-2 = 0.06) and adult
   female quenda by 140.1 g (95\% CI 3.9-276.3 g; p = 0.044; adjusted R-2 =
   0.07), with study findings suggesting a tendency towards obesity in
   urbanised environments. Adult female quenda in bushland had increased
   odds of an active pouch (adjusted OR = 4.89, 95\% CI 1.7-14.5),
   suggesting decreased reproductive activity in quenda from urbanised
   environments. These results highlight the subtle, yet extensive impacts
   that urbanised environments may have on wildlife ecology, even for those
   species which apparently adjust well to urbanisation. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In present study. blood samples were collected randomly from 439 cows at
   three main regions of Egypt (northern, central and southern). Molecular
   diagnosis of Babesia and Theileria infections by PCR amplification of

Abstract = {{Animals should time activities, such as foraging, migration and
   reproduction, as well as seasonal physiological adaptation, in a way
   that maximizes fitness. The fitness outcome of such activities depends
   largely on their interspecific interactions; the temporal overlap with
   other species determines when they should be active in order to maximize
   their encounters with food and to minimize their encounters with
   predators, competitors and parasites. To cope with the constantly
   changing, but predictable structure of the environment, organisms have
   evolved internal biological clocks, which are synchronized mainly by
   light, the most predictable and reliable environmental cue ( but which
   can be masked by other variables), which enable them to anticipate and
   prepare for predicted changes in the timing of the species they interact
   with, on top of responding to them directly. Here, we review examples
   where the internal timing system is used to predict interspecific
   interactions, and how these interactions affect the internal timing
   system and activity patterns. We then ask how plastic these mechanisms
   are, how this plasticity differs between and within species and how this
   variability in plasticity affects interspecific interactions in a
   changing world, in which light, the major synchronizer of the biological
   clock, is no longer a reliable cue owing to the rapidly changing
   climate, the use of artificial light and urbanization.

Abstract = {{Extensive field surveys of rodents were conducted in Cambodia from 2008
   to 2014 to study the diversity and ecology of helminth infection in wild
   rodent populations. Gastrointestinal helminths were isolated from 14
   species of rodents (569 individuals) trapped from different habitats
   (forest, dry land, rain-fed land and human settlements) in four
   provinces of Cambodia (Krong Preah Sihanouk, Mondolkiri, Pursat and
   Steung Treng). The average prevalence of parasitic infection was 58.5\%
   (range, 16.0-64.7\%), and 19 helminth taxa were identified in total.
   Trichostrongylid nematodes were the most prevalent (25.8\%), followed by
   Raillietina sp. (14.1\%), Gongylonema neoplasticum (10.7\%), Syphacia
   muris (9.8\%) and Hymenolepis diminuta (9.6\%). Potential rodent-borne
   zoonotic helminths were also identified, and the risks of helminthiasis
   were discussed. The status of helminth infection and species diversity
   in rodents from settlements were significantly lower than in rodents
   from forest and peri-domesticated habitats, which indicates that habitat
   alteration might affect helminth infection and diversity in rodent
   hosts. Generalized linear models revealed that host attributes (host
   species and maturity) and environmental factors (habitat and
   geographical location) were explanatory variables for helminth infection
   in these rodents. Using network analyses, we showed that the oriental
   house rat, Rattus tanezumi, was the most central host in the
   rodent-helminth assemblage, based on the number of helminth taxa it
   shared with other rodent species. Therefore, R. tanezumi could play an
   important role in rodent-helminth interactions and helminth transmission

Abstract = {{Nest building is a taxonomically widespread and diverse trait that
   allows animals to alter local environments to create optimal conditions
   for offspring development. However, there is growing evidence that
   climate change is adversely affecting nest-building in animals directly,
   for example via sea-level rises that flood nests, reduced availability
   of building materials, and suboptimal sex allocation in species
   exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination. Climate change is
   also affecting nesting species indirectly, via range shifts into
   suboptimal nesting areas, reduced quality of nest-building environments,
   and changes in interactions with nest predators and parasites. The
   ability of animals to adapt to sustained and rapid environmental change
   is crucial for the long-term persistence of many species. Many animals
   are known to be capable of adjusting nesting behaviour adaptively across
   environmental gradients and in line with seasonal changes, and this
   existing plasticity potentially facilitates adaptation to anthropogenic
   climate change. However, whilst alterations in nesting phenology, site
   selection and design may facilitate short-term adaptations, the ability
   of nest-building animals to adapt over longer timescales is likely to be
   influenced by the heritable basis of such behaviour. We urgently need to
   understand how the behaviour and ecology of nest-building in animals is
   affected by climate change, and particularly how altered patterns of
   nesting behaviour affect individual fitness and population persistence.
   We begin our review by summarising how predictable variation in
   environmental conditions influences nest-building animals, before
   highlighting the ecological threats facing nest-building animals
   experiencing anthropogenic climate change and examining the potential
   for changes in nest location and/or design to provide adaptive short-
   and long-term responses to changing environmental conditions. We end by
   identifying areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for

Abstract = {{Plant-parasitic nematodes are major pests in agriculture. Microbial
   antagonists such as nematophagous fungi are of great interest for
   developing alternative biocontrol strategies to replace nematicide use.
   This study aims to isolate, identify and assess the diversity and the in
   vitro predatory activity of nematophagous fungi from various olive
   nurseries in Morocco. A total of 305 soil samples were collected in 25
   nurseries in Moroccan olive-producing areas (Jbala, Guerouane, Haouz and
   Souss). Seventy-three pure fungal strains from nematophagous fungi were
   recovered from nursery substrates infested with root-knot nematodes.
   Diversity indices showed that fungi were more numerous in southern
   regions, whereas fungal communities were more numerically alike in
   northern regions, partly depending on the occurrence of root-knot
   nematodes. One fungal strain, Talaromyces assiutensis, killed all
   Meloidogyne javanica juveniles during in vitro predation tests.
   Orbiliaceae (Arthrobotrys spp., Drechslerella brochopaga, Monacrosporium
   spp.) trapped 50 to 80\% of juveniles. Purpureocillium and Trichoderma
   species killed 30 to 50\% of juveniles. The diversity of nematophagous
   communities could be affected by the north-south climate gradient of
   Morocco, by their nematode prey expansion, and, to a lesser extent, by
   the habitat origin of the substrates used. Talaromyces assiutensis was
   the most efficient nematophagous species against M. javanica. The use of
   native nematophagous fungi is a promising alternative strategy for
   nematode control in olive nurseries and to prevent nematode introduction

Abstract = {{The poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae (de Geer), is a
   hematophagous mite of economic importance in the poultry industry.
   Because PRM lives off-host in habitats potentially shared by many
   micropredators, bio-control agents have potential to regulate this pest
   in poultry buildings. The present pilot study was conducted to obtain a
   first insight into predatory and parasitic arthropod communities that
   naturally occur on layer farms in France. Species composition and
   sensitivity to insecticides were determined to estimate the feasibility
   of conservation biological control (CBC) of PRM based on a 2-scale
   concept (regional and local effects). A morpho-molecular approach was
   used to characterize the taxonomic composition of manure-dwelling
   arthropod communities, with a focus on mesostigmatid mites, that
   naturally occur in free-range layer farms. Additionally, the sensitivity
   of some dominant mite species to a common insecticide (deltamethrin) was
   measured via bioassays. The putative roles of recorded taxa within
   ecological guilds and their dispersal habits are discussed based on the
   results of multivariate and univariate analyses. Local and regional
   factors had significant effects on both highlevel taxonomic arthropod
   groups and mesostigmatid morphospecies. In addition to documenting the
   occurrence and apparent establishment of highly mobile arthropods in hen
   houses, these results are considered promising for the development of
   CBC against PRM. Populations of two recurrent mesostigmatid
   morphospecies demonstrated an extreme sensitivity to the pyrethroid,
   suggesting that even very low levels of insecticide use are likely to
   have unnoticed deleterious effects on natural regulation processes in
   layer buildings. Lastly, a robust method for exploring mesostigmatid
   mite communities in manure is provided.}},

Abstract = {{American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a growing public health
   problem in Panama, and further forest degradation due to human
   population growth is expected to worsen the situation. Most people
   infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are silently ill, and their
   life expectancy is severely compromised, which contributes to further
   deterioration of living conditions in endemic regions. Here, we review
   the outcomes of nearly 100 years of ecological and epidemiological
   investigation about Chagas disease in Panama, in an attempt to highlight
   progress, identify needs, and re-orient future efforts. Rhodnius
   pallescens and Triatoma dimidiata are both primary vectors of T. cruzi
   in Panama, but R. pallescens seems more efficient in human-altered
   forest ecosystems due to a greater degree of association with Attalea
   butyracea. In contrast, T. dimidiata transmits T. cruzi efficiently
   under more sylvatic conditions (e.g. settlements inside old-growth or
   secondary forest patches), where its populations reach considerable
   numbers irrespective of the absence of A. butyracea. A trend of
   increasing forest degradation, suburbanization, and development of
   tourism in Panama favoring the establishment of A. butyracea and other
   palm tree species (Acrocomia sp.) suggests that a colonist species like
   R. pallescens will continue to play a more prominent role in the
   transmission of T. cruzi than a forest specialist like T. dimidiata.
   However, studies about the taxonomic status and ecology of these vectors
   are still needed in Panama to address their transmission potential
   fully. The implementation of an active surveillance system and education
   programs could greatly minimize the risk of Chagas disease transmission
   in Panama, preventing fatal infections in children from endemic areas.}},

Abstract = {{Trophically-transmitted parasites are regularly exposed to potential new
   hosts through food web interactions. Successful colonization, or
   switching, to novel hosts, occur readily when `donor' and `target' hosts
   are phylogenetically related, whereas switching between distantly
   related hosts is rare and may result from stochastic factors (i.e. rare
   favourable mutations). This study investigates a host-switching event
   between a marine acanthocephalan specific to pinnipeds that is
   apparently able to reproduce in Magellanic penguins Spheniscus
   magellanicus from Brazil. Detailed analysis of morphological and
   morphometrical data from acanthocephalans from penguins indicates that
   they belong to Corynosoma australe Johnston, 1937. Partial fragments of
   the 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cox1 genes were amplified from isolates
   from penguins and two pinniped species (i.e. South American sea lion
   Otaria flavescens and South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis)
   to confirm this identification. Infection parameters clearly differ
   between penguins and the two pinniped species, which were significantly
   lower in S. magellanicus. The sex ratio of C. australe also differed
   between penguins and pinnipeds; in S. magellanicus was strongly biased
   against males, while in pinnipeds it was close to 1:1. Females of C.
   australe from O. flavescens were smaller than those from S. magellanicus
   and A. australis. However, fecundity (i.e. the proportion of fully
   developed eggs) was lower and more variable in females collected from S.
   magellanicus. At first glance, the occurrence of reproductive
   individuals of C. australe in Magellanic penguins could be interpreted
   as an adaptive colonization of a novel avian host through favourable
   mutations. However, it could also be considered, perhaps more likely, as
   an example of ecological fitting through the use of a plesimorphic
   (host) resource, since the ancestors of Corynosoma infected aquatic

Abstract = {{Evolution and dispersion history on Earth of organisms can best be

   The biological diversity of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis was
   investigated in different cladistic approaches. First the morphological
   aspects were explored in connection with its ecology. More recently,
   molecular aspects were investigated to better understand the nature of
   the variations observed among isolates. The study of the tandemly
   repeated multilocus microsatellite EmsB allowed us to attain a high
   genetic diversity level where other classic markers have failed. Since
   2006, EmsB data have been collected on specimens from various endemic
   foci of the parasite in Europe (in historic and newly endemic areas),
   Asia (China, Japan and Kyrgyzstan), and North America (Canada and
   Alaska). Biological data on the isolates and metadata were also recorded
   (e.g. host, geographical location, EmsB analysis, citation in the
   literature). In order to make available the data set of 1,166 isolates
   from classic and aberrant domestic and wild animal hosts (larval lesions
   and adult worms) and from human origin, an open web access interface,
   developed in PHP, and connected to a PostgreSQL database, was developed
   in the EmsB Website for the Echinococcus Typing (EWET) project. It
   allows researchers to access data collection, perform genetic analyses
   online (e.g. defining the genetic distance between their own samples and
   the samples in the database), consult distribution maps of EmsB
   profiles, and record and share their new EmsB genotyping data. In order
   to standardize the EmsB analyses performed in the different laboratories
   throughout the world, a calibrator was developed. The final aim of this
   project was to gather and arrange available data to permit to better
   understand the dispersion and transmission patterns of the parasite
   among definitive and intermediate hosts, in order to organize control

Abstract = {{Haemadipsid leeches are among the most successful terrestrial
   invertebrates in Bornean rainforests. They are very common ectoparasites
   of vertebrate, and their abundance has facilitated the conduction of
   numerous projects in the fields of ecology, zoogeography and taxonomy.
   We undertook research on two species inhabiting lowland dipterocarp
   forest, Haemadipsa picta Moore, 1929 and Haemadipsa subagilis (Moore,
   1929), in order to address the following questions: (a) is there a
   difference in leech abundance between trails and off-trails?; (b) is
   ambush location dependent on specimen size or is species-specific?; (c)
   is intra-and interspecific competition limited by differences in
   foraging behaviours or vertical niche partitioning? Our results clearly
   show that H. picta is more abundant on trails than on off-trails and is
   vertically dispersed within the understory; the size of a specimen is
   strongly correlated with plant height. Haemadipsa subagilis was found
   not to exhibit such patterns. We suggest a possible lowering of
   interspecific competition between these species as a result of: (i)
   size-dependent dispersion of H. picta (together with reduction of
   intraspecific competition); and (ii) habitat specialisation of H.
   subagilis. Moreover, we provide new observations on their foraging
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses originating from wildlife
   among which vector-borne diseases constitute a major risk for global
   human health. Understanding the transmission routes of mosquito-borne
   pathogens in wildlife crucially depends on recording mosquito
   blood-feeding patterns. During an extensive longitudinal survey to study
   sylvatic anophelines in two wildlife reserves in Gabon, we collected
   2,415 mosquitoes of which only 0.3\% were blood-fed. The molecular
   analysis of the blood meals contained in guts indicated that all the
   engorged mosquitoes fed on wild ungulates. This direct approach gave
   only limited insights into the trophic behavior of the captured
   mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed a complementary indirect approach
   that exploits the occurrence of natural infections by host-specific
   haemosporidian parasites to infer Anopheles trophic behavior. This
   method showed that 74 infected individuals carried parasites of great
   apes (58\%), ungulates (30\%), rodents (11\%) and bats (1\%).
   Accordingly, on the basis of haemosporidian host specificity, we could
   infer different feeding patterns. Some mosquito species had a restricted
   host range (An.nili only fed on rodents, whereas An.carnevalei,
   An.coustani, An.obscurus, and An.paludis only fed on wild ungulates).
   Other species had a wider host range (An.gabonensis could feed on
   rodents and wild ungulates, whereas An.moucheti and An.vinckei bit
   rodents, wild ungulates and great apes). An.marshallii was the species
   with the largest host range (rodents, wild ungulates, great apes, and
   bats). The indirect method substantially increased the information that
   could be extracted from the sample by providing details about
   host-feeding patterns of all the mosquito species collected (both fed
   and unfed). Molecular sequences of hematophagous arthropods and their
   parasites will be increasingly available in the future; exploitation of
   such data with the approach we propose here should provide key insights
   into the feeding patterns of vectors and the ecology of vector-borne
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We examined seasonal prevalence in avian haemosporidians (Plasmodium and

   We investigated how infection with haemosporidians in avian hosts is

   along with host abundance and life-history traits (body mass). Using
   molecular methods for parasite detection and sequencing partial
   cytochrome b gene, 12 Plasmodium and 27 Haemoproteus lineages were
   isolated. Our 1-year study from December 2008 to December 2009 in
   tropical Himalayan foothills revealed a lack of seasonal variation in
   Plasmodium spp. prevalence in birds despite a strong correlation between
   mosquito abundance and temperature. The probability of infection with
   Plasmodium decreased with increase in temperature. Total parasite
   prevalence and specifically Plasmodium prevalence showed an increase
   with average avian body mass. In addition, total prevalence exhibited a
   U-shaped relationship with avian host abundance. There was no difference
   in prevalence of Plasmodium spp. or Haemoproteus spp. across altitudes;
   parasite prevalence in high-altitude locations was mainly driven by the
   seasonal migrants. One Haemoproteus lineage showed cross-species
   infections between migrant and resident birds. This is the first
   molecular study in the tropical Himalayan bird community that emphasizes
   the importance of studying seasonal variation in parasite prevalence.
   Our study provides a basis for further evolutionary study on the

   macroinvertebrates}},
Journal = {{TOXICON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{120-127}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The dermal glands of many amphibian species secrete toxins or other
   noxious substances as a defense strategy against natural enemies. Newts
   in particular possess the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), for
   which the highest concentrations are found in species within the genus
   Taricha. Adult Taricha are hypothesized to use TTX as a chemical defense
   against vertebrate predators such as garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.).
   However, less is known about how TTX functions to defend
   aquatic-developing newt larvae against natural enemies, including
   trematode parasites and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Here we
   experimentally investigated the effects of exogenous TTX exposure on
   survivorship of the infectious stages (cercariae) of five species of
   trematode parasites that infect larval amphibians. Specifically, we used
   dose-response curves to test the sensitivity of trematode cercariae to
   progressively increasing concentrations of TTX (0.0 {[}control], 0.63,
   3.13, 6.26, 3132, and 62.64 nmol L-1) and how this differed among
   parasite species. We further compared these results to the effects of
   TTX exposure (0 and 1000 nmolL(-1)) over 24 h on seven macroinvertebrate
   taxa commonly found in aquatic habitats with newt larvae. TTX
   significantly reduced the survivorship of trematode cercariae for all
   species, but the magnitude of such effects varied among species.
   Ribeiroia ondatrae - which causes mortality and limb malformations in
   amphibians - was the least sensitive to TTX, whereas the
   kidney-encysting Echinostoma trivolvis was the most sensitive. Among the
   macroinvertebrate taxa, only mayflies (Ephemeroptera) showed a
   significant increase in mortality following exogenous TTX exposure,
   despite the use of a concentration 16x higher than the maximum used for
   trematodes. Our results suggest that maternal investment of TTX into
   larval newts may provide protection against certain trematode infections
   and highlight the importance of future work assessing the effects of
   newt toxicity on both parasite infection success and the palatability of
   larval newts to invertebrate predators. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{123-132}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fungal infection of plants alters plant metabolism and therefore their
   chemistry, by either increasing levels of defence compounds or
   decreasing levels of nutrients. Such alterations in plants, in turn,
   influence the performance of the insects that feed on them. Pathogenic
   fungi live on plants as either biotrophs or necrotrophs. Both bio- and
   necrotrophic fungi alter the physiologies of plants in distinctly
   different pathways. This article explores the patterns of relationships
   evident between insects and plants, the latter infected by biotrophic
   and necrotrophic fungi, using established examples from the vertically
   and horizontally transmitted biotrophic, endophytic fungi. A curious
   pattern evident in such interactions refers to the biotrophic,
   endophytic fungi that live in galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae
   (Diptera). The insects associated with necrotrophic fungi stand distinct
   from the patterns of interactions evident among insects, plants, and
   fungi. An understanding of the ecology of three-way interactions
   involving distantly related organisms, viz, insects, fungi, and plants,
   will bear long-term consequences in the better management of annual crop
   and perennial forest trees. A majority of previously published papers in
   the context of insect-plant-fungus interactions liberally use the terms
   `mutualism' and `symbiosis', implicating the various benefits conferred
   on one or more of the participants. In the examples referred to, and the
   interacting contexts analyzed in this paper, what emerges is that the
   fungus is parasitically associated with the plant. In the eventuality of
   an insect interacting with the infected (= parasitized) plant, the
   insect gains (e.g., gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae) or in occasional
   instances the plant gains (e.g., Epichloe infections of Poaceae). A
   unifying model for insect-plant-fungus interacting systems is not
   readily apparent. The only possible explanation is the independent
   origins of insect behaviour in either preferring or rejecting the
   fungus-infected plants. This is possibly driven by specific
   environmental conditions, in which a specific fungus-plant-insect system
   would be operating. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological

Abstract = {{Parasite epidemics may be influenced by interactions among symbionts,

   parasite interactions and phenology in epidemics, we embedded multiple
   cohorts of sentinel plants, grown from seeds with and without a

   Within hosts, parasite growth was influenced by coinfections, but
   coinfections were often prevented by priority effects among symbionts.
   Across hosts, parasite phenology altered host susceptibility to
   secondary infections, symbiont interactions and ultimately the magnitude

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing rate of urbanization, the consequences of this

   were to identify the general pattern of urbanization impact on
   background insect herbivory, to explore variations in this impact
   related to characteristics of both urban areas and insect-plant systems,
   and to uncover the factors governing urbanization impacts on insect
   herbivory. We compared the foliar damage inflicted on the most common
   trees by defoliating, leafmining and gall-forming insects in rural and
   urban habitats associated with 16 European cities. In two of these
   cities, we explored quality of birch foliage for herbivorous insects,
   mortality of leafmining insects due to predators and parasitoids and
   bird predation on artificial plasticine larvae. On average, the foliage
   losses to insects were 16.5\% lower in urban than in rural habitats. The
   magnitude of the overall adverse effect of urbanization on herbivory was
   independent of the latitude of the locality and was similar in all 11
   studied tree species, but increased with an increase in the size of the
   urban area: it was significant in large cities (city population 1-5
   million) but not significant in medium-sized and small towns. Quality of
   birch foliage for herbivorous insects was slightly higher in urban
   habitats than in rural habitats. At the same time, leafminer mortality
   due to ants and birds and the bird attack intensity on dummy larvae were
   higher in large cities than in rural habitats, which at least partially
   explained the decline in insect herbivory observed in response to
   urbanization. Our findings underscore the importance of top-down forces
   in mediating impacts of urbanization on plant-feeding insects: factors
   favouring predators may override the positive effects of temperature
   elevation on insects and thus reduce plant damage.}},

Abstract = {{Social predators benefit from cooperation in the form of increased
   hunting success, but may be at higher risk of disease infection due to
   living in groups. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the
   impact of disease transmission on the population dynamics benefits
   provided by group hunting. We consider a predator-prey model with
   foraging facilitation that can induce strong Allee effects in the
   predators. We extend this model by an infectious disease spreading
   horizontally and vertically in the predator population. The model is a
   system of three nonlinear differential equations. We analyze the
   equilibrium points and their stability as well as one-and two-parameter
   bifurcations. Our results show that weakly cooperating predators go
   unconditionally extinct for highly transmissible diseases. By contrast,
   if cooperation is strong enough, the social behavior mediates
   conditional predator persistence. The system is bistable, such that
   small predator populations are driven extinct by the disease or a lack
   of prey, and large predator populations survive because of their
   cooperation even though they would be doomed to extinction in the
   absence of group hunting. We identify a critical cooperation level that
   is needed to avoid the possibility of unconditional predator extinction.
   We also investigate how transmissibility and cooperation affect the
   stability of predator-prey dynamics. The introduction of parasites may
   be fatal for small populations of social predators that decline for
   other reasons. For invasive predators that cooperate strongly,
   biocontrol by releasing parasites alone may not be sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{Cannibalism is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon that can
   fundamentally affect the structure and stability of aquatic communities,
   including the emergence of a bimodal size distribution (dwarfs and
   giants) in fish populations. Emergence of giants could also be driven or
   facilitated by parasites that divert host resources from reproduction to
   growth. We studied the trophic ecology of giant nine-spined sticklebacks
   (Pungitius pungitius) in a Finnish pond to evaluate the hypotheses that
   gigantism in this population would be facilitated by cannibalism and/or
   parasitic infections by Schistocephalus pungitii cestode. Stomach
   content analyses revealed an initial ontogenetic dietary shift from
   small to large benthic invertebrates, followed by cannibalism on
   10-20-mm-long conspecifics by giant individuals. However, stable
   nitrogen isotopes (N-15) indicated a concave relationship between fish
   size and trophic position, with relatively low trophic position
   estimates suggesting only facultative cannibalism among giants. The
   unexpectedly high trophic position of the intermediate-sized fish may
   reflect substantial, but temporary, predation on eggs or
   young-of-the-year conspecifics, but may also partly result from
   starvation caused by S. pungitii infection. However, it seems
   implausible that parasitic infections (i.e. castration) would explain
   gigantism among nine-spined sticklebacks because all >100-mm giants were
   unparasitised. Hence, the present results suggest that an ontogenetic
   niche shift from an invertebrate diet to intercohort cannibalism may
   facilitate the occurrence of gigantism in nine-spined sticklebacks.}},

Abstract = {{The effective and eco-friendly control of Anopheles vectors plays a key
   role in any malaria management program. Integrated Vector Management
   (IVM) suggests making use of the full range of vector control tools
   available. The strategies for IVM require novel technologies to control
   outdoor transmission of malaria. Despite the wide number of promising
   control tools tested against mosquitoes, current strategies for malaria
   vector control used in most African countries are not sufficient to
   achieve successful malaria control. The majority of National Malaria
   Control Programs in Africa still rely on indoor residual spraying (IRS)
   and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). These methods reduce malaria
   incidence but generally have little impact on malaria prevalence. In
   addition to outdoor transmission, growing levels of insecticide
   resistance in targeted vectors threaten the efficacy of LLINs and IRS.
   Larvicidal treatments can be useful, but are not recommended for rural
   areas. The research needed to improve the quality and delivery of
   mosquito vector control should focus on (i) optimization of processes
   and methods for vector control delivery; (ii) monitoring of vector
   populations and biting activity with reliable techniques; (iii) the
   development of effective and eco-friendly tools to reduce the burden or
   locally eliminate malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases; (iv) the
   careful evaluation of field suitability and efficacy of new mosquito
   control tools to prove their epidemiological impact; (v) the continuous

   vector populations; (vi) the cooperation among different disciplines,
   with main emphasis on parasitology, tropical medicine, ecology,
   entomology, and ecotoxicology. A better understanding of behavioral
   ecology of malaria vectors is required. Key ecological obstacles that

   mosquito behavior, development of insecticide resistance, presence of
   behavioral avoidance, high vector biodiversity, competitive and food web
   interactions, lack of insights on mosquito dispersal and mating
   behavior, and the impact of environmental changes on mosquito ecological
   traits. Overall, the trans-disciplinary cooperation among

   validity. The opportunity to examine a larger series of ticks from a
   wider range of hosts than previously available has led to the finding of
   a morphologically close and hitherto undescribed species, which is
   herewith described and named as Ixodes laridis sp. nov. The new species
   has a superficial similarity to its sibling, I. eudyptidis, but on close
   examination it displays a number of morphological differences that
   justify its taxonomic separation. Also, the hosts of the new species are
   principally gulls, gannets and cormorants, while I. eudyptidis is
   restricted to penguins. The recognition of this new species has
   implications for faunal lists in both New Zealand and Australia, as well
   for seabird health, as it appears that I. eudyptidis does not cause
   paresis as originally thought, but it is I. laridis that causes
   potentially fatal paralysis in its hosts.
   A taxonomic history and review of I. eudyptidis and keys to all stages
   of the species of Ixodes recorded from New Zealand, and from Australian
   seabirds are given. Reference to Ixodes kohlsi Arthur, 1955, a species
   currently restricted to Australia, is made for comparative purposes
   because of the similarity of both its morphology and host associations
   with the other species under consideration. Aspects of the distribution,
   zoogeography, hosts and ecology of all three species of ticks are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Continental-scale, data-driven predictive assessment of eliminating the
   vector-borne disease, lymphatic filariasis, in sub-Saharan Africa by
   2020}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are growing demands for predicting the prospects of
   achieving the global elimination of neglected tropical diseases as a
   result of the institution of large-scale nation-wide intervention
   programs by the WHO-set target year of 2020. Such predictions will be
   uncertain due to the impacts that spatial heterogeneity and scaling
   effects will have on parasite transmission processes, which will
   introduce significant aggregation errors into any attempt aiming to
   predict the outcomes of interventions at the broader spatial levels
   relevant to policy making. We describe a modeling platform that
   addresses this problem of upscaling from local settings to facilitate
   predictions at regional levels by the discovery and use of
   locality-specific transmission models, and we illustrate the utility of
   using this approach to evaluate the prospects for eliminating the
   vector-borne disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in sub-Saharan Africa
   by the WHO target year of 2020 using currently applied or newly proposed
   intervention strategies.
   Methods and Results: We show how a computational platform that couples
   site-specific data discovery with model fitting and calibration can
   allow both learning of local LF transmission models and simulations of
   the impact of interventions that take a fuller account of the fine-scale
   heterogeneous transmission of this parasitic disease within endemic
   countries. We highlight how such a spatially hierarchical modeling tool
   that incorporates actual data regarding the roll-out of national drug
   treatment programs and spatial variability in infection patterns into
   the modeling process can produce more realistic predictions of timelines
   to LF elimination at coarse spatial scales, ranging from district to
   country to continental levels. Our results show that when locally
   applicable extinction thresholds are used, only three countries are
   likely to meet the goal of LF elimination by 2020 using currently
   applied mass drug treatments, and that switching to more intensive drug
   regimens, increasing the frequency of treatments, or switching to new
   triple drug regimens will be required if LF elimination is to be
   accelerated in Africa. The proportion of countries that would meet the
   goal of eliminating LF by 2020 may, however, reach up to 24/36 if the
   WHO 1\% microfilaremia prevalence threshold is used and sequential mass
   drug deliveries are applied in countries.
   Conclusions: We have developed and applied a data-driven spatially
   hierarchical computational platform that uses the discovery of locally
   applicable transmission models in order to predict the prospects for
   eliminating the macroparasitic disease, LF, at the coarser country level
   in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in
   local parasite transmission and extinction dynamics, as well as the
   exact nature of intervention roll-outs in countries, will impact the
   timelines to achieving national LF elimination on this continent.}},

Title = {{Sleeping site ecology, but not sex, affect ecto- and hemoparasite risk,

   edwardsi)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: A central question in evolutionary parasitology is to what
   extent ecology impacts patterns of parasitism in wild host populations.
   In this study, we aim to disentangle factors influencing the risk of
   parasite exposure by exploring the impact of sleeping site ecology on
   infection with ectoparasites and vector-borne hemoparasites in two
   sympatric primates endemic to Madagascar. Both species live in the same
   dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar and cope with the same
   climatic constraints, they are arboreal, nocturnal, cat-sized and
   pair-living but differ prominently in sleeping site ecology. The Western
   woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis) sleeps on open branches and frequently
   changes sleeping sites, whereas the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur
   (Lepilemur edwardsi) uses tree holes, displaying strong sleeping site
   fidelity. Sleeping in tree holes should confer protection from
   mosquito-borne hemoparasites, but should enhance the risk for
   ectoparasite infestation with mites and nest-adapted ticks. Sex may
   affect parasite risk in both species comparably, with males bearing a
   higher risk than females due to an immunosuppressive effect of higher
   testosterone levels in males or to sex-specific behavior. To explore
   these hypotheses, ectoparasites and blood samples were collected from 22
   individuals of A. occidentalis and 26 individuals of L. edwardsi during
   the dry and rainy season.
   Results: L. edwardsi, but not A. occidentalis, harbored ectoparasites,
   namely ticks (Haemaphysalis lemuris {[}Ixodidae], Ornithodoros sp.
   {[}Argasidae]) and mites (Aetholaelaps trilyssa, {[}Laelapidae]),
   suggesting that sleeping in tree holes promotes infestation with
   ectoparasites. Interestingly, ectoparasites were found solely in the
   hot, rainy season with a prevalence of 75\% (N = 16 animals). Blood
   smears were screened for the presence and infection intensity of
   hemoparasites. Microfilariae were detected in both species.
   Morphological characteristics suggested that each lemur species harbored
   two different filarial species. Prevalence of microfilarial infection
   was significantly lower in L. edwardsi than in A. occidentalis. No
   significant difference in infection intensity between the two host
   species, and no effect of season, daytime of sampling or sex on
   prevalence or infection intensity was found. In neither host species,
   parasite infection showed an influence on body weight as an indicator
   for body condition.
   Conclusions: Our findings support that sleeping site ecology affects
   ectoparasite infestation in nocturnal, arboreal mammalian hosts in the
   tropics, whereas there is no significant effect of host sex. The
   influence of sleeping site ecology to vector-borne hemoparasite risk is
   less pronounced. The observed parasite infections did not affect body
   condition and thus may be of minor importance for shaping reproductive
   fitness. Findings provide first evidence for the specific relevance of
   sleeping site ecology on parasitism in arboreal and social mammals.
   Further, our results increase the sparse knowledge on ecological drivers
   of primate host-parasite interactions and transmission pathways in
   natural tropical environments.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Background. Coexistence of sexual and asexual populations remains a key
   question in evolutionary ecology. We address the question how an asexual
   and a sexual form of the parasitoid Venturia canescens can coexist in
   southern Europe. We test the hypothesis that both forms are adapted to
   different habitats within their area of distribution. Sexuals inhabit
   natural environments that are highly unpredictable, and where density of
   wasps and their hosts is low and patchily distributed. Asexuals instead
   are common in anthropic environments (e.g., grain stores) where host
   outbreaks offer periods when egg-load is the main constraint on
   reproductive output.
   Methods. We present a meta-analysis of known adaptations to these
   habitats. Differ ences in behavior, physiology and life-history traits
   between sexual and asexual wasps were standardized in term of effect
   size (Cohen's d value; Cohen, 1988).
   Results. Seeking consilience from the differences between multiple
   traits, we found that sexuals invest more in longevity at the expense of
   egg-load, are more mobile, and display higher plasticity in response to
   thermal variability than asexual counterparts.
   Discussion. Thus, each form has consistent multiple adaptations to the
   ecological circumstances in the contrasting environments.}},

   Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{59}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Animal trypanosomosis is one of the major disease problems
   affecting agricultural productivity in Ethiopia. The impact of the
   disease is believed to vary with season and agro-ecologies in line with
   fly vector distribution. A cross-sectional study on bovine
   trypanosomosis was conducted from November 2015 to June 2016, in seven
   selected villages of Gidami district, Oromia Regional State, western
   Ethiopia. A total of 930 blood samples were collected and subjected to
   parasitological and hematological analysis.
   Result: The overall prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis was 14.1\%. The
   seasonal prevalence shows 9.06\% in early dry and 18.4\% in early rainy
   seasons. Three trypanosome species, Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma
   vivax and Trypanosoma brucei were identified in the examined animals. T.
   congolense followed by T. vivax were the predominant species
   (respectively 59.0 and 35.9\% in early dry season and 62.0 and 22.8\% in
   early rainy season). The prevalence of T. vivax remained similar in both
   early dry and early rainy seasons in both lowland and midland
   agroecologies whereas T. congolense was more dominant in the lowland
   area in both seasons compared to mid land study sites. The disease was
   more prevalent in lowland (23.9\%) compared to midland (11.1\%) during
   early rainy season (P < 0.001) whereas no significant difference was
   observed between the two agroecologies during early dry season (P =
   0.165). Packed cell volume (PCV) was much lower in parasitemic animals
   than in aparasitemic cattle whereas the mean PCV value for parasitemic
   animals (20.36\%; 95\% CI 19.56 to 21.16) in early dry season was
   similar to values in early rainy season (20.46\%, 95\% CI 18.84 to
   21.08\%). A similar situation was noticed for animals in both low land
   and mid land study sites.
   Conclusion: Overall, the detection of trypanosomes in blood was
   significantly affected by agro-ecology, season and body condition of the
   animals. Special emphasis should be given to integrated trypanosomosis
   management in early rainy months where fly population is believed to
   start increasing.}},

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Small islands serve as potential malaria reservoirs through
   which new infections might come to the mainland and may be important
   targets in malaria elimination efforts. This study investigated malaria
   vector species diversity, blood-meal hosts, Plasmodium infection rates,
   and long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage on Mageta, Magare and
   Ngodhe Islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya, a region where
   extensive vector control is implemented on the mainland.
   Results: From trapping for six consecutive nights per month (November
   2012 to March 2015) using CDC light traps, pyrethrum spray catches and
   backpack aspiration, 1868 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected. Based on
   their cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and intergenic spacer region PCR and
   sequencing, Anopheles gambiae s.l. (68.52\%), Anopheles coustani
   (19.81\%) and Anopheles funestus s.l. (11.67\%) mosquitoes were
   differentiated. The mean abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes per building
   per trap was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in Mageta than in Magare
   and Ngodhe. Mageta was also the most populated island (n = 6487) with
   low LLIN coverage of 62.35\% compared to Ngodhe (n = 484; 88.31\%) and
   Magare (n = 250; 98.59\%). Overall, 416 (22.27\%) engorged Anopheles
   mosquitoes were analysed, of which 41 tested positive for Plasmodium
   falciparum infection by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of 18S
   rRNA and cytochrome b PCR products. Plasmodium falciparum infection
   rates were 10.00, 11.76, 0, and 18.75\% among blood-fed An. gambiae s.s.
   (n = 320), Anopheles arabiensis (n = 51), An. funestus s. s. (n = 29),
   and An. coustani (n = 16), respectively. Based on HRM analysis of
   vertebrate cytochrome b, 16S rRNA and COI PCR products, humans (72.36\%)
   were the prominent blood-meal hosts of malaria vectors, but 20.91\% of
   blood-meals were from non-human vertebrate hosts.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate high Plasmodium infection rates
   among the primary malaria vectors An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis,
   as well as in An. coustani for the first time in the region, and that
   non-human bloodmeal sources play an important role in their ecology.
   Further, the higher Anopheles mosquito abundances on the only low LLIN
   coverage island of Mageta suggests that high LLIN coverage has been
   effective in reducing malaria vector populations on Magare and Ngodhe
   Islands.}},

Abstract = {{In ecological communities consumers (excluding parasites and

   pyramids' or the ` pyramid of numbers', and metabolic arguments suggest
   that this pattern is independent of the number of trophic levels in a
   system. At the same time, Lotka-Volterra (LV) consumer-resource models
   are a frequently used tool to study many questions in community ecology,
   but their capacity to produce Eltonian pyramids has not been formally
   analysed. Here, I address this knowledge gap by investigating if and

   Eltonian pyramids are difficult to reproduce without density-dependent
   mortality in the consumers, unless biologically plausible relationships

Abstract = {{The copepod species Calanus glacialis is an important component of
   arctic marine food webs, where it is the numerically dominant
   zooplankton grazer and serves as a major prey item for fish, seabirds,
   and other predators. These copepods are typically considered to be
   phytoplanktivorous, although they are also known to feed on
   microzooplankton, and little is known about their diet in fall and
   winter. To investigate their feeding, C. glacialis gut contents were
   analyzed over an annual cycle in a seasonally ice covered arctic fjord
   using next generation sequencing of 18S rDNA. During the spring bloom,
   diatoms, particularly Thalassiosira spp., were important contributors to
   the dietary sequence reads. In addition to diatoms, Chytridiomycetes,
   fungal parasites of diatoms, also made up a large proportion of dietary
   sequence reads during this productive season. This provides one of the
   first indications of the potential importance of the mycoloop in marine
   environments. Just prior to the spring bloom, chaetognath sequences
   dominated the prey sequence reads from C. glacialis, suggesting
   potential predation on eggs or other early life stages of chaetognaths
   by C. glacialis. Other indications of omnivorous feeding outside of the
   spring bloom period included sequence reads from polychaetes in summer,
   at the time of peak polychaete larval abundance, and from Metridia spp.
   ( Copepoda) in winter in prey sequences from C. glacialis. Incorporating

Abstract = {{Prey should adjust their defences against natural enemies to match their
   current level of risk and balance other needs. This is particularly
   important when optimal defences represent trade-offs, as is the case
   with many predator-induced trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) that
   are antagonistic to those promoting host resistance to parasites and
   pathogens. However, trade-offs may depend on whether different natural
   enemies are present simultaneously or represent temporally discrete
   threats. We found that larval amphibians (Anaxyrus americanus)
   previously exposed to predator cues did not engage in anti-parasite
   behaviours (activity increases) in response to a current risk of
   infection by a pathogenic trematode parasite compared to controls,
   resulting in higher infection intensities. This suggests that the memory
   of the likely more lethal threat (predation) had greater influence,
   maladaptively dampening tadpole activity. Incorporating complexity
   inherent in natural systems, including spatial and temporal overlap, is
   necessary to better understand natural enemy ecology and howTMIEs relate

Abstract = {{Nesting success has been a surrogate to assess environmental changes

   at ``El Zapotal{''} Recreational Ecological Preserve, Central Chiapas.
   During the 2015 breeding season, we intensively searched for active
   nests and evaluated habitat characteristics. We located a total of 56
   nests of which 27 (48.2 \%) were successful and 29 (51.7 \%) were
   unsuccessful. Most unsuccessful nests (19) were depredated, while 8
   (27.6 \%) were abandoned and 2 (6.9 \%) parasitized. Nesting success was
   46 \%. Depredation was the main mechanism of nest failure, mostly during
   incubation. We identified operating variables at site and patch scales.
   Through analysis of binary logistic regression models for each scale, we
   predicted which variables increased the probability of nesting success.
   We also performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to rule
   out possible interactions among variables. At nest scale we found that
   nest height, ranging 4.2 - 5.1 m had increased nesting success, while at
   patch scale, the probability of nest success was greater at sites with a
   tree density >= 12. Our results indicated that the probability of
   nesting success did not show a relationship between scales. We suggest a
   decoupling between scales and mechanism. Thus, habitat changes occurring
   at local scale did not seem to interfere with the patch scale. Also, our
   results showed that variation in characteristics at nest scale could
   also influence depredation, when depredation had been presented at
   random, since nests with medium and high probability of being
   successful, failed also for this reason. Thus, in order to understand
   the factors, mechanisms and life history characteristics influencing
   nesting success, we suggest that in addition to the environmental
   variables, future studies should also consider the bird nesting
   behaviour.}},

   Banderas Bay (BB), on the Pacific coast of Mexico, were studied during
   two consecutive years. A total of 536 fish were collected and 19
   parasite taxa registered (six digeneans, two cestodes, nine nematodes,

   (Helicometrina nimia, Siphodera vinaledwardsii, Tetraphyllidea gen. sp.,
   Pseudoterranova sp., Ancyrocephalidae gen. sp. and Microcotyloides
   incisa) as well as the infracommunity indices varied significantly
   between MB and BB, and among dry and rainy seasons; however, no clear
   seasonal patterns were observed. Pseudoterranova larvae appeared
   frequently in MB, possibly because of the presence of the California sea
   lion in this locality. Similarity analysis did not show a clear
   separation of parasite species composition between both localities,
   which suggest that fish samples came from a single population of L.

Abstract = {{Boring insects feed on the internal tissues of their hosts, and their
   activity is detected only after a severe damage to the host has
   occurred; therefore, studying their biology in the wild is difficult.
   The objective of the study was to complement knowledge about the
   biology, ecology and taxonomic position of Comadia redtenbacheri
   (Hammerschmidt, 1847), an agave borer with a long lifecycle. Laboratory
   observations were made on life stages obtained from larvae collected in
   Hidalgo, Mexico, which were induced to pupate in tubes with vermiculite
   and soil. Emerged adults were placed in cloth bags where they mated and
   laid eggs. Larvae that emerged from these eggs were raised on an
   artificial diet. Field observations were made in some localities of the
   State of Mexico; for this, external leaves and rhizomes of Agave plants
   were examined to look for eggs and larvae. Eggs and larvae were found in
   Agave salmiana Otto ex Salm-Dyck and Agave applanata Lem. ex Jacobi.
   Eggs are brown; they are found mainly at the base of external leaves.
   Neonate larvae bore a hole in the chorion and feed on it for a few days;
   they are gregarious and migrate towards the rhizome as they mature; last
   instar larvae are aposematic and release a volatile odoriferous
   secretion; their development is not uniform and can last more than a
   year. Pupation takes place in a silken cocoon under the soil. Adults are
   nocturnal; female calling starts one hour after the start of the
   scotophase, and can last until 5:30 am; oviposition happens a few hours
   after mating. The parasitoids Lisonnota fascipennis Townes, 1978
   (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and Acantholespesia texana (Aldrich \&
   Webber, 1924) (Diptera: Tachinidae) and fungal and bacterial pathogens
   are commonly found in larvae. Predators of larvae and adults include
   ants, rodents and birds.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Reflecting on his scientific career toward the end of his life, the
   French-educated medical researcher Rene' Dubos presented his flowering
   as an ecological thinker as a story of linear progression-the inevitable
   product of the intellectual seeds planted in his youth. But how much
   store should we set by Dubos's account of his ecological journey?
   Resisting retrospective biographical readings, this paper seeks to
   relate the development of Dubos's ecological ideas to his experimental
   practices and his career as a laboratory researcher. In particular, I
   focus on Dubos's studies of tuberculosis at the Rockefeller Institute in
   the period 1944-1956-studies which began with an inquiry into the
   tubercle bacillus and the physiochemical determinants of virulence, but
   which soon encompassed a wider investigation of the influence of
   environmental forces and host-parasite interactions on susceptibility
   and resistance to infection in animal models. At the same time, through
   a close reading of Dubos's scientific papers and correspondence, I show
   how he both drew on and distinguished his ecological ideas from those of
   other medical researchers such as Theobald Smith, Frank Macfarlane
   Burnet, and Frank Fenner. However, whereas Burnet and Fenner tended to
   view ecological interactions at the level of populations, Dubos focused
   on the interface of hosts and parasites in the physiological
   environments of individuals. The result was that although Dubos never
   fully engaged with the science of ecology, he was able to incorporate
   ecological ideas into his thought and practices, and relate them to his
   holistic views on health and the natural harmony of man and his
   environment.}},

   their parasites were sampled at 13 locations along the island's

   Surprisingly, no population structure was observed for T. zealandica. In
   fact, sequencing of three commonly used markers revealed no
   intraspecific parasite variation. This result suggests that mermithid

Abstract = {{Despite increasing appreciation for parasitism as an important component
   of primate ecology and evolution, surprisingly few studies have
   demonstrated the costs of helminth parasitism in primates. Detecting
   parasite-related costs in primates is particularly difficult because it
   requires detailed, long-term data on individual host reproductive
   success, survival, and parasitism. The identification of the larval
   tapeworm Taenia serialis in geladas under intensive long-termstudy in
   the Ethiopian Highlands (Nguyen et al. {[}2015] American Journal of
   Primatology, 77: 579-594; Schneider-Crease et al. {[}2013] Veterinary
   Parasitology 198: 240-243) provides an opportunity to examine how an
   endemic parasite impacts host reproductive success and survival. We used
   survival analyses to assess the mortality risk associated with
   protuberant larval cysts characteristic of T. serialis using a decade of
   data from a gelada population in the Simien Mountains National Park
   (SMNP), Ethiopia. We demonstrated strikingly high mortality associated
   with T. serialis cysts in adult females, particularly for younger
   adults. The estimated effect of cysts on male mortality was similar,
   although the effect was not statistically significant, likely owing to
   the smaller sample size. Additionally, the offspring of mothers with
   cysts experienced increased mortality, which was driven almost entirely
   by maternal death. Mothers with cysts had such high mortality that they
   rarely completed an interbirth interval. Comparison with a study of this
   parasite in another gelada population on the Guassa Plateau (Nguyen et
   al. {[}2015] American Journal of Primatology, 77: 579-594) revealed
   lower cyst prevalence in the SMNP and similar cyst-associated mortality.
   However, many more females with cysts completed interbirth intervals at
   Guassa than in the SMNP, suggesting that T. serialis cysts may kill
   hosts more rapidly in the SMNP. Our results point toward the underlying
   causes of individual and population-level heterogeneity in T.
   serialis-associated mortality as important areas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on plerocercoids of the cestode Diphyllobothrium

   Heimdalsvatn in south-central Norway. Salmo trutta was the only fish
   species in this lake until European minnow Phoxinus phoxinus was
   registered in 1969. The P. phoxinus population increased substantially
   in the following years. In contrast with the 1969-1972 period, when
   plerocercoids of D. ditremum were practically absent in S. trutta, there
   was a high prevalence and intensity of infection in the 2013 S. trutta
   samples. Because the life cycle of D. ditremum involves two larval
   stages, in copepods and salmonids and mature worms in piscivorous birds,
   such as mergansers and loons, a change in feeding ecology of S. trutta
   or changes in population densities of copepods, fish or birds might have
   influenced the infection pattern. No relationships between D. ditremum
   infection and muscle-tissue N-15 signature or Hg concentration were
   found, indicating that infection is not a result of piscivory or
   cannibalism. Furthermore, consumption of copepods by S. trutta during
   summer and autumn was low. On the other hand, the number of piscivorous
   birds has increased, probably due to the presence of P. phoxinus as a
   new and numerous prey. An increased number of final D. ditremum hosts
   may have produced a higher output of cestode eggs, resulting in more
   infected copepods that in turn are consumed by S. trutta. Indirectly, P.
   phoxinus may therefore have caused the observed increased infection in
   S. trutta and thereby imposed further negative effects on S. trutta in

Volume = {{247}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The negative effects of climate change on cocoa production are often
   enhanced through agricultural intensification, while research
   institutions and enterprises try to minimize yield gaps with production
   strategies mitigating climate risk. Ecological intensification is such a
   production strategy, whereby yield increase is promoted through reduced
   agrochemical inputs and increased regulating ecosystem services such as
   pollination. However, we still know little about cocoa pollination
   ecology and services, although they appear to be key to understand yield
   functions. Here, we provide an extensive literature review on cocoa
   pollination focusing on three main aspects: non-plant (external) and
   plant regulated (internal) factors affecting pollination, pollinator
   agents, and ecological intensification management for enhancing
   pollination success and yield. Pollination services by many arthropod
   groups such as ants, bees, and parasitic wasps, and not only
   ceratopogonids, may be a way to increase cocoa productivity and secure
   smallholders income, but their role is unknown. Several environmental
   and socioeconomic factors can blur potential pollination benefits.
   Current knowledge gaps preclude our understanding of how to (i) identify
   the major pollinator species, (ii) disentangle the direct or indirect
   role of ants in pollination, (iii) design effective habitat improvements
   for pollination (by litter and shade management), and (iv) quantify the
   yield gaps due to pollination limitation. Optimizing cocoa pollination
   alone appears to be a powerful ecological tool to increase the yield of
   smallholders, but experimental research is required to validate these
   results in a realistic setting. In general, industry, governments and
   smallholders need to develop more joined efforts to ecological
   produdtion strategies. In particular, farm-base management innovations
   based on robust scientific evidence must be designed to meet the
   increasing demand for chocolate and to mitigate cocoa yield gaps. This
   review suggests that diversified systems and associated ecosystem
   services, such as pollination, can help to achieve such goals.}},

   a tachinid parasitoid-caterpillar food web from the Ecuadorian Andes
   based on >70000 caterpillar collections. Our goals were to assess how
   host taxon and feeding niche affects parasitism by flies and wasps,
   evaluate perceptions of broad diet breadth in tachinids, characterise
   the structure of the food web, and assess how sample size affects
   inferences about community structure. We found high levels of parasitism
   (>28\%) by tachinid and wasp parasitoids and a rich tachinid community
   (279 spp.). Concealed caterpillars experienced low parasitism by
   tachinids and were more likely to be attacked by species with indirect
   oviposition. Indirect ovipositing tachinids had greater host ranges, but
   this is confounded with tachinid phylogeny. Caterpillar families
   exhibited nearly opposite patterns of susceptibility to parasitism by
   tachinids and wasps. Network metrics indicate that this tachinid-host
   community is relatively compartmentalised and nested, and though some
   taxa display broad host ranges, the network as a whole is moderately
   specialised due to constrained host ranges of many tachinid species.
   This study establishes an exemplar tropical tachinid-host food web,

   parasitoids. Additional studies are needed to determine how these

   2011 and April 2012 in eastern and southeastern Kenya (Kitui,
   Mwingi/Yatta and Loitokitok areas). Monthly observations on kale
   infestation by diamondback moth, damage scores, parasitism and

   farmer-managed kale farms. Sampled larval and pupal stages were placed
   in containers and taken to the laboratory for parasitoid emergence. The
   infestation levels ranged from 0.4 to 2.5 DBM per plant, while damage
   scores ranged from 1.2 to 1.6, which correlated with the infestation
   levels. Cotesia vestalis was not only the most abundant parasitoid, but
   it had also spread to new areas from the release sites. In December, the
   three sites recorded an average of 50\% from C. vestalis. Excluding the
   exotic parasitoids C. vestalis and D. semiclausum, indigenous
   parasitoids accounted for less than 5\% total parasitism. The parasitoid

   composition and the predation rate along flower vs. grass margins at the
   edge of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields in Denmark. Natural
   enemies were sampled by pitfall trapping and by suction sampling;
   predation intensity was measured using two different sentinel prey

   colonies. Specialist and generalist species responded differently to the
   two margin types: specialists (mostly parasitic wasps) were attracted by
   the flower margins, while generalists (ground beetles, rove beetles and

Abstract = {{There have been notable and significant advances in elucidating the
   chemical ecology of the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera:
   Pentatomidae), brown marmorated stink bug. This highly destructive and
   polyphagous pest is originally from Korea, China, and Japan, but was
   accidentally introduced into North America and Europe. Prior to its
   invasion into these regions, little was known about its chemical
   ecology. However, since then, researchers have identified and
   synthesized its aggregation pheromone, documented its synergism with the
   pheromone of another Asian stink bug, Plautia stali, developed
   monitoring traps of various designs, and lures with reliable attractants
   have become commercially available. Furthermore, plant volatiles have
   been shown to have attractive, neutral, and repellent effects on
   attraction and retention of H. halys, and H. halys-derived volatiles
   have been shown to play a role in recruiting natural enemies. Finally,
   management strategies based on pheromone-based technology have been
   evaluated, including insecticide applications based on a cumulative
   threshold of adult captures in pheromone-baited traps, and the use of
   intensively baited trees in an attract-and-kill strategy to manage this
   pest. This review summarizes the available literature on the chemical
   ecology of H. halys and concludes with several research areas that
   should be explored in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Biological control is an important ecosystem service delivered by
   natural enemies. Together with breeding for plant defence, it
   constitutes one of the most promising alternatives to pesticides for
   controlling herbivores in sustainable crop production. Especially
   induced plant defences may be promising targets in plant breeding for
   resistance against arthropod pests. Because they are activated upon
   herbivore damage, costs are only incurred when defence is needed.
   Moreover, they can be more specific than constitutive defences.
   Nevertheless, inducible defence traits that are harming plant pest
   organisms may interfere with biological control agents, such as
   predators and parasitoids. Despite the vast fundamental knowledge on
   plant defence mechanisms and their effects on natural enemies, our
   understanding of the feasibility of combining biological control with
   induced plant defence in practice is relatively poor. In this review, we
   focus on arthropod pest control and present the most important features
   of biological control with natural enemies and of induced plant defence.
   Furthermore, we show potential synergies and conflicts among them and,
   finally, identify gaps and list opportunities for their combined use in
   crop protection. We suggest that breeders should focus on inducible
   resistance traits that are compatible with the natural enemies of
   arthropod pests, specifically traits that help communities of natural
   enemies to build up. (c) 2017 The Authors. Pest Management Science

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deviation of sex ratios from unity in wild animal
   populations has recently been demonstrated to be far more prevalent than
   previously thought. Ectoparasites are prominent examples of this bias,
   given that their sex ratios vary from strongly female-to strongly
   male-biased both among hosts and at the metapopulation level. To date
   our knowledge is very limited on how and why these biased sex ratios
   develop. It was suggested that sex ratio and sex-specific aggregation of
   ectoparasites might be shaped by the ecology, behaviour and physiology
   of both hosts and their parasites. Here we investigate a highly
   specialised, hematophagous bat fly species with strong potential to move
   between hosts, arguably limited inbreeding effects, off-host
   developmental stages and extended parental care.
   Results: We collected a total of 796 Nycteribia kolenatii bat flies from
   147 individual bats using fumigation and subsequently determined their
   sex. We report a balanced sex ratio at the metapopulation level and a
   highly variable sex ratio among infrapopulations ranging from 100\% male
   to 100\% female. We show that infrapopulation sex ratio is not random
   and is highly correlated with infrapopulation size. Sex ratio is highly
   male biased in small and highly female biased in large infrapopulations.
   We show that this pattern is most probably the result of sex-specific
   preference in bat flies for host traits, most likely combined with a
   higher mobility of males. We demonstrate that female bat flies exert a
   strong preference for high host body condition and female hosts, while
   the distribution of males is more even.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that locally biased sex ratios can
   develop due to sex-specific habitat preference of parasites. Moreover,
   it is apparent that the sex of both hosts and parasites need to be
   accounted for when a better understanding of host-parasite systems is
   targeted.}},

Title = {{Context-dependent medicinal effects of anabasine and infection-dependent
   toxicity in bumble bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Floral phytochemicals are ubiquitous in nature, and can function both as
   antimicrobials and as insecticides. Although many phytochemicals act as
   toxins and deterrents to consumers, the same chemicals may counteract
   disease and be preferred by infected individuals. The roles of nectar
   and pollen phytochemicals in pollinator ecology and conservation are
   complex, with evidence for both toxicity and medicinal effects against
   parasites. However, it remains unclear how consistent the effects of
   phytochemicals are across different parasite lineages and environmental
   conditions, and whether pollinators actively self-medicate with these
   compounds when infected.
   Approach
   Here, we test effects of the nectar alkaloid anabasine, found in
   Nicotiana, on infection intensity, dietary preference, and survival and
   performance of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens). We examined variation in
   the effects of anabasine on infection with different lineages of the
   intestinal parasite Crithidia under pollen-fed and pollen-starved
   conditions.
   Results
   We found that anabasine did not reduce infection intensity in individual
   bees infected with any of four Crithidia lineages that were tested in
   parallel, nor did anabasine reduce infection intensity in microcolonies
   of queenless workers. In addition, neither anabasine nor its isomer,
   nicotine, was preferred by infected bees in choice experiments, and
   infected bees consumed less anabasine than did uninfected bees under
   no-choice conditions. Furthermore, anabasine exacerbated the negative
   effects of infection on bee survival and microcolony performance.
   Anabasine reduced infection in only one experiment, in which bees were
   deprived of pollen and post-pupal contact with nestmates. In this
   experiment, anabasine had antiparasitic effects in bees from only two of
   four colonies, and infected bees exhibited reduced-rather than
   increased-phytochemical consumption relative to uninfected bees.
   Conclusions
   Variation in the effect of anabasine on infection suggests potential
   modulation of tritrophic interactions by both host genotype and
   environmental variables. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bombus
   impatiens prefer diets without nicotine and anabasine, and suggest that
   the medicinal effects and toxicity of anabasine may be context
   dependent. Future research should identify the specific environmental
   and genotypic factors that determine whether nectar phytochemicals have
   medicinal or deleterious effects on pollinators.}},

   cascades by favoring generalist over specialist herbivores}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Global interest on plant-microbe-insect interactions is rapidly growing,
   revealing the multiple ways in which microorganisms mediate
   plant-herbivore interactions. Phytopathogens regularly alter whole
   repertoires of plant phenotypic traits, and bring about shifts in key
   chemical or morphological characteristics of plant hosts. Pathogens can
   also cause cascading effects on higher trophic levels, and eventually
   shape entire plant-associated arthropod communities. We tested the
   hypothesis that a Candidatus Phytoplasma causing cassava witches' broom
   (CWB) on cassava (Manihot esculenta Grantz) is altering species
   composition of invasive herbivores and their associated parasitic
   hymenopterans. We conducted observational studies in cassava fields in
   eastern Cambodia to assess the effect of CWB infection on abundance of
   specialist and generalist mealybugs (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), and
   associated primary and hyper-parasitoid species. CWB infection
   positively affects overall mealybug abundance and species richness at a
   plant-and field-level, and disproportionately favors a generalist
   mealybug over a specialist feeder. CWB phytoplasma infection led to
   increased parasitoid richness and diversity, with richness of
   `comparative' specialist taxa being the most significantly affected.
   Parasitism rate did not differ among infected and uninfected plants, and
   mealybug host suppression was not impacted. CWB phytoplasma modifies
   host plant quality for sap-feeding homopterans, differentially affects
   success rates of two invasive species, and generates niche opportunities
   for higher trophic orders. By doing so, a Candidatus phytoplasma affects
   broader food web structure and functioning, and assumes the role of an
   ecosystem engineer. Our work unveils key facets of phytoplasma ecology,
   and sheds light upon complex multi-trophic interactions mediated by an
   emerging phytopathogen. These findings have further implications for
   invasion ecology and management.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Triatomines, also known as kissing bugs, which are found
   throughout the world and especially in Latin America, are well known
   natural vectors that transmit American trypanosomiasis, also called
   Chagas disease. In China, the presence of two species of Triatoma
   (Triatoma rubrofasciata and T. sinica) was recorded in the past. Due to
   the growing population and the increasing risk of the global spread of
   Chagas disease, triatomines became a potential public health nuisance,
   and in 2016, we started monitoring triatomine activities in southern
   China.
   Methods: Triatomine specimens were collected by the National Institute
   of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and
   Prevention, and identified by their morphological characteristics under
   a dissecting microscope. In addition to morphological analysis, the
   genomic DNA of the specimens was extracted, and the mitochondrial 16S
   rRNA, the cytochrome b (CytB) gene and the nuclear ribosomal 28S rRNA
   gene were PCR-amplified to analyze and confirm the species genetically.
   Results: One female adult insect and one male adult insect were
   collected in a dwelling in the rural area of Shunde County, Foshan City,
   Guangdong Province, China (22 degrees 42'44.63 `' N, 113 degrees
   08'45.34 `' E). The results from the morphological and genetic analyses
   indicated that these triatomines were T. rubrofasciata.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that the occurrence of T.
   rubrofasciata has been confirmed in Foshan City, Guangdong Province in
   southern China. Further studies are needed to reach a clearer
   understanding of the ecology of this species of triatomine, since it has
   been found to be naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi and T.

   Coleoptera and Orthoptera contributing the most important items. The
   width of the mouth affected the volume of prey consumed by P.

   whole. There were ontogenetic changes in the types of prey in the diet
   of P. mantiqueira, with no ingestion of Coleopteran adults by juvenile
   frogs (< 26 mm). The clutch size of females of P. mantiqueira (692-923
   eggs) was similar to those reported for the congeners P. appendiculata
   and P. tupinamba, but slightly smaller than those recorded for larger
   species of Proceratophrys such as P. boiei and P. caramaschii. Despite
   occurring at relatively low densities in the study area, P. mantiqueira
   had a high prevalence of infection by helminthes (90\%), possibly
   because the helminth parasite community was mostly composed by
   host-generalists and monoxenous life-cycle species. Diet composition and

Abstract = {{The origin of mitochondria is a unique and hard evolutionary problem,

   to the egalitarian nature of the transition where lower-level units took
   over energy metabolism. Contending theories widely disagree on ancestral

   open questions but there is no comparative examination of hypotheses. We
   have specified twelve questions about the observable facts and hidden
   processes leading to the establishment of the endosymbiont that a valid
   hypothesis must address. We have objectively compared contending
   hypotheses under these questions to find the most plausible course of
   events and to draw insight on missing pieces of the puzzle. Since
   endosymbiosis borders evolution and ecology, and since a realistic
   theory has to comply with both domains' constraints, the conclusion is
   that the most important aspect to clarify is the initial ecological
   relationship of partners. Metabolic benefits are largely irrelevant at
   this initial phase, where ecological costs could be more disruptive.
   There is no single theory capable of answering all questions indicating

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Parasites can impose strong selection on hosts. In response, some host
   populations have adapted via the evolution of defenses that prevent or
   impede infection by parasites. However, host populations have also
   evolved life history shifts that maximize host fitness despite
   infection. Outcrossing and self-fertilization can have contrasting
   effects on evolutionary trajectories of host populations. While selfing
   and outcrossing are known to affect the rate at which host populations
   adapt in response to parasites, these mating systems may also influence
   the specific traits that underlie adaptation to parasites. Here, we
   determined the role of evolved host defense versus altered life history,
   in mixed mating (selfing and outcrossing) and obligately outcrossing C.
   elegans host populations after experimental evolution with the bacterial
   parasite, S. marcescens. Similar to previous studies, we found that both
   mixed mating and obligately outcrossing host populations adapted to S.
   marcescens exposure, and that the obligately outcrossing populations
   exhibited the greatest rates of adaptation. Regardless of the host
   population mating system, exposure to parasites did not significantly
   alter reproductive timing or total fecundity over the course of
   experimental evolution. However, both mixed mating and obligately
   outcrossing host populations exhibited significantly reduced mortality
   rates in the presence of the parasite after experimental evolution.
   Therefore, adaptation in both the mixed mating and obligately
   outcrossing populations was driven, at least in part, by the evolution
   of increased host defense and not changes in host life history. Thus,
   the host mating system altered the rate of adaptation, but not the
   nature of adaptive change in the host populations.}},

   sex ratio would be female biased because it is known that female
   ectoparasites dominate on poorer hosts. The body size of a random sample

Abstract = {{The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) is well-known in ecology
   providing an explanation for the role of disturbance in the coexistence

   describe the role of forest disturbance in shaping the mosquito
   community structure, and to identify the ecological processes that
   increase the emergence of vector-borne disease. Mosquitoes were
   collected in central Panama at immature stages along linear transects in
   colonising, mixed and climax forest habitats, representing different
   levels of disturbance. Species were identified taxonomically and
   classified into functional categories (i.e., colonist, climax,
   disturbance-generalist, and rare). Using the Huisman-Olff-Fresco
   multi-model selection approach, IDH testing was done. We did not detect
   a unimodal relationship between species diversity and forest disturbance
   expected under the IDH; instead diversity peaked in old-growth forests.
   Habitat complexity and constraints are two mechanisms proposed to
   explain this alternative postulate. Moreover, colonist mosquito species
   were more likely to be involved in or capable of pathogen transmission

Abstract = {{In the arms race between plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies,
   specialized herbivores may use plant defenses for their own benefit, and
   variation in plant traits may affect the benefits that herbivores derive
   from these defenses. Pieris brassicae is a specialist herbivore of
   plants containing glucosinolates, a specific class of defensive
   secondary metabolites. Caterpillars of P. brassicae are known to
   actively spit on attacking natural enemies, including their main
   parasitoid, the braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that variation in the secondary metabolites of host plants
   affects the efficacy of caterpillar regurgitant as an anti-predator
   defense. Using a total of 10 host plants with different glucosinolate
   profiles, we first studied natural regurgitation events of caterpillars
   on parasitoids. We then studied manual applications of water or
   regurgitant on parasitoids during parasitization events. Results from
   natural regurgitation events revealed that parasitoids spent more time
   grooming after attack when foraging on radish and nasturtium than on
   Brassica spp., and when the regurgitant came in contact with the wings
   rather than any other body part. Results from manual applications of
   regurgitant showed that all parameters of parasitoid behavior (initial
   attack duration, attack interruption, grooming time, and likelihood of a
   second attack) were more affected when regurgitant was applied rather
   than water. The proportion of parasitoids re-attacking a caterpillar
   within 15 min was the lowest when regurgitant originated from radish-fed
   caterpillars. However, we found no correlation between glucosinolate
   content and regurgitant effects, and parasitoid behavior was equally
   affected when regurgitant originated from a glucosinolate-deficient
   Arabidopsis thaliana mutant line. In conclusion, host plant affects to a
   certain extent the efficacy of spit from P. brassicae caterpillars as a
   defense against parasitoids, but this is not due to glucosinolate
   content. The nature of the defensive compounds -present in the spit
   remains to be determined, and the ecological relevance of
   this-anti-predator defense needs to be further evaluated in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Stylostomes (feeding tubes) of Hirsutiella zachvatkini (Schluger)

   and of Trombidium holosericeum (L.) (Trombidiidae), feeding on larvae of
   Stenodemini sp. (Heteroptera, Miridae), were studied by TEM methods and
   on semi-thin sections. The stylostome of H. zachvatkini is a homogeneous
   structure of low electron density and without strict margins. It extends
   within the concave host epidermis, undergoing hyperplasia and
   hyperkeratosis. TEM does not reveal any obvious stratification in the
   stylostome walls. The cheliceral movable digits are moved apart by 5-6 A
   mu m and tightly applied/adhered to the stylostome substance. A local
   area beneath the open end of the stylostome canal is not empty but
   contains a nearly homogeneous substrate, which can pass into the central
   stylostome canal. The latter is mostly free of contents. In contrast to
   H. zachvatkini, larvae of T. holosericeum form a root-like stylostome
   chaotically branching within the clear space underneath the host cuticle
   free of tissue elements. Tubules of the distal stylostome branches
   become progressively thinner and disappear blindly. As in H.
   zachvatkini, the stylostome walls of T. holosericeum are devoid of
   stratification but show moderate to high electron density. The
   cheliceral movable digits are moved apart by the same distance, as in H.
   zachvatkini, and tightly applied to the stylostome substance. The lumen
   of the central canal is either electron lucent, in the distal portions,
   or filled with a fine granular or homogeneous substrate of low electron
   density in the proximal portions forming a type of ampoule. This study
   shows that Trombiculidae and Trombidiidae share similar initial stages
   of stylostome formation but the resultant stylostome of each family is
   distinctly different.}},

Abstract = {{Two praying mantids, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis Saussure and Tenodera
   angustipennis Saussure, are commonly found in the same old-field
   habitats in the eastern United States and in much of temperate zone
   Asia. Naturally established populations of these two species were
   studied intensively over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) in an old
   field in southeastern Virginia, to compare life history features
   relevant to how they coexist, or whether one or the other of them is
   likely to be more successful in the same habitat. Populations of both
   species declined about 50\% from 2010 to 2011 (adults from 47 to 21 for
   T. a. sinensis; 37 to 20 for T. angustipennis), but T. a. sinensis
   oviposited 10 oothecae and T. angustipennis only one in 2011. Tenodera
   a. sinensis was more abundant in the study site in both years, hatched
   earlier, and matured and oviposited earlier than T. angustipennis. Fewer
   females of both species survived to maturity in 2011 than in 2010,
   possibly indicating a reduction in prey or habitat suitability in 2011.
   We suggest that T. angustipennis will always be at a disadvantage as a
   result of its smaller body size, because of interspecific predation (and
   potentially competition) from its congener, lower clutch size, and
   susceptibility to egg parasitism. Further, environmental variability
   across field habitats and years profoundly affects populations of both

Abstract = {{A major force contributing to the emergence of novelty in nature is the
   presence of cooperative interactions, where two or more components of a
   system act in synergy, sometimes leading to higher-order, emergent
   phenomena. Within molecular evolution, the so called hypercycle defines
   the simplest model of an autocatalytic cycle, providing major
   theoretical insights on the evolution of cooperation in the early
   biosphere. These closed cooperative loops have also inspired our
   understanding of how catalytic loops appear in ecological systems. In
   both cases, hypercycle and ecological cooperative loops, the role played
   by space seems to be crucial for their stability and resilience against
   parasites. However, it is difficult to test these ideas in natural
   ecosystems, where time and spatial scales introduce considerable
   limitations. Here, we use engineered bacteria as a model system to a
   variety of environmental scenarios identifying trends that transcend the
   specific model system, such an enhanced genetic diversity in
   environments requiring mutualistic interactions. Interestingly, we show
   that improved environments can slow down mutualistic range expansions as
   a result of genetic drift effects preceding local resource depletion.
   Moreover, we show that a parasitic strain is excluded from the
   population during range expansions (which acknowledges a classical
   prediction). Nevertheless, environmental deterioration can reshape
   population interactions, this same strain becoming part of a
   three-species mutualistic web in scenarios in which the two-strain
   mutualism becomes non functional. The evolutionary and ecological
   implications for the design of synthetic ecosystems are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites can represent formidable selection pressures for hosts, but
   the cost of infection is sometimes difficult to demonstrate in natural
   populations. While parasite exploitation strategies may, in some
   instances, actually inflict low costs on their hosts, the response of
   hosts to infection is also likely to determine whether or not these
   costs can be detected. Indeed, costs of infection may be obscured if
   infected individuals in the wild are those that are the most tolerant,
   rather than the most susceptible, to infection. Here we test this
   hypothesis in two natural populations of Anolis sagrei, one of the most
   common anole lizard of the Bahamas. Plasmodium parasites were detected
   in >7\% of individuals and belonged to two distinct clades: P. mexicanum
   and P. floriensis. Infected individuals displayed greater body condition
   than non-infected ones and we found no association between infection
   status, stamina, and survival to the end of the breeding season.
   Furthermore, we found no significant difference in the immuno-competence
   (measured as a response to phytohemagglutinin challenge) of infected
   versus non-infected individuals. Taken together, our results suggest
   that the infected individuals that are caught in the wild are those most
   able to withstand the cost of the infection and that susceptible,
   infected individuals have been removed from the population (i.e.,
   through disease-induced mortality). This study highlights the need for
   caution when interpreting estimates of infection costs in natural
   populations, as costs may appear low either when parasites exploitation
   strategies truly inflict low costs on their hosts or when those costs
   are so high that susceptible hosts are removed from the population.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Helminths cause a number of medical and agricultural problems and are a
   major cause of parasitic infections in humans, animals and plants.
   Comparative analysis of helminth genes and genomes are important to
   understand the genomic biodiversity and evolution of parasites and their
   hosts in terms of different selective pressures in their habitats. The
   interactions between the infective organisms and their hosts are
   mediated in large part by secreted proteins, known collectively as the
   ``secretome{''}. Proteins secreted by parasites are able to modify a
   host's environment and modulate their immune system. The composition and
   function of this set of proteins varies depending on the ecology,
   lifestyle and environment of an organism. The present study aimed to
   predict, in silico, the secretome in 44 helminth species including
   Nematoda (31 species) and Platyhelminthes (13 species) and, understand
   the diversity and evolution of secretomes. Secretomes from plant
   helminths range from 7.6\% (943 proteins) to 13.9\% (2,077 proteins) of
   the filtered proteome with an average of 10.2\% (1,412 proteins) and
   from free-living helminths range from 4.4\% (870 proteins) to 13\%
   (3,121 proteins) with an average of 9.8\% (2,126 proteins),
   respectively, and thus are considerably larger secretomes in relation to
   animal helminth secretomes which range from 4.2\% (431 proteins) to
   11.8\% (2,419 proteins) of the proteomes, with an average of 7.1\% (804
   proteins). Across 44 secretomes in different helminth species, we found
   five conserved domains: (i) PF00014 (Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin
   inhibitor domain), (ii) PF00046 (Homeobox domain), (iii) PF00188
   (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1
   proteins), (iv) PF00085 (Thioredoxin) and (v) PF07679 (Immunoglobulin
   I-set domain). Our results detected secreted proteins associated with
   invasion, infection, adhesion and immunoregulation processes as protease
   inhibitors and cytokines, among other functions. In summary, this study
   will contribute towards the understanding of host-parasite interactions
   and possibly identify new molecular targets for the treatment or
   diagnosis of helminthiases. (C) 2017 Australian Society for

Abstract = {{Bats are recognized as potential hosts of pathogens exploiting the food

   about their endoparasites, especially for Neotropical bats. In this
   study, we assessed the helminth fauna associated with 3 insectivorous
   bat species roosting in the same single hot cave in central Veracruz,
   Mexico: Mormoops megalophylla, Pteronotus davyi, and Pteronotus
   personatus. During a period of 1 yr (April 2007-2008), 135 mormoopid
   bats in total were collected and examined for helminths. Six parasite
   species representing 3 types of intestinal helminths were found: 1
   cestode Vampirolepis elongatus; 2 trematodes Maxbraunium tubiporum and
   Ochoterenatrema labda; and 3 nematodes Linustrongylus pteronoti,
   Molineidae gen. sp., and Capillaria sp. Overall, trematodes were the
   most abundant parasite group (72.4\%), followed by nematodes (20.7\%)
   and cestodes (6.9\%). Species-accumulation curves suggest that the worms
   collected (n = 1,331) from these 6 parasite species comprise the
   helminth fauna associated with the 3 bat populations studied. The only
   species shared by the 3 bat species was Capillaria sp. Most (5/6) of the
   helminth species recorded use Lepidoptera and Diptera as intermediate
   hosts; therefore, diet is likely the main source of infection. Although
   insectivorous bats are considered dietary generalist species, the
   differences found in helminth diversity in these sympatric populations
   of closely related bat species, suggest that diet partitioning occurs in
   mormoopid bat communities. Helminths tend to exploit the food chain to
   reach their final hosts; therefore, studying these parasites can provide
   useful information to further understand the biology of bats.}},

   Firstly, culture media were compared by evaluating the mycelial growth

Abstract = {{The aquatic environment represents the final repository for many
   human-generated pollutants associated with anthropogenic activities. The
   quality of natural freshwater systems is easily disrupted by the
   introduction of pollutants from urban, industrial and agricultural
   processes. To assess the extent of chemical perturbation and associated
   environmental degradation, physico-chemical parameters have been
   monitored in conjunction with biota in numerous biological monitoring
   protocols. Most studies incorporating organisms into such approaches
   have focussed on fish and macroinvertebrates. More recently, interest in
   the ecology of parasites in relation to environmental monitoring has
   indicated that these organisms are sensitive towards the quality of the
   macroenvironment. Variable responses towards exposure to pollution have
   been identified at the population and component community level of a
   number of parasites. Furthermore, such responses have been found to
   differ with the type of pollutant and the lifestyle of the parasite.
   Generally, endoparasite infection levels have been shown to become
   elevated in relation to poorer water quality conditions, while
   ectoparasites are more sensitive, and exposure to contaminated
   environments resulted in a decline in ectoparasite infections.
   Furthermore, endoparasites have been found to be suitable accumulation
   indicators for monitoring levels of several trace elements and metals in
   the environment. The ability of these organisms to accumulate metals has
   further been observed to be of benefit to the host, resulting in
   decreased somatic metal levels in infected hosts. These trends have
   similarly been found for host-parasite models in African freshwater
   environments, but such analyses are comparatively sparse compared to
   other countries. Recently, studies on diplozoids from two freshwater
   systems have indicated that exposure to poorer water quality resulted in
   decreased infections. In the Vaal River, the poor water quality resulted
   in the extinction of the parasite from a site below the Vaal River
   Barrage. Laboratory exposures have further indicated that oncomiracidia
   of Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon are sensitive to exposure to dissolved
   aluminium. Overall, parasites from African freshwater and marine
   ecosystems have merit as effect and accumulation indicators; however,
   more research is required to detail the effects of exposure on sensitive
   biological processes within these organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of immunity from mother to offspring is a central way to
   endow the offspring with increased protection against pathogens. This
   phenomenon is not only found within the vertebrate domain: in some

   immune kick-start, which is termed trans-generational immune priming
   (TGIP). TGIP has been uncovered for a number of invertebrate species,
   but it is not ubiquitously evident. The reasons for which are not known.
   In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Tate, Andolfatto, Demuth, and Graham
   (2017) probe the molecular underpinnings of TGIP in concert with the
   temporal dynamics of the response in the red flour beetle, Tribolium
   castaneum, infected with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Figure

   TGIP, meaning that when averaged across several experiments, the
   offspring of mothers infected with heat-killed bacteria had better
   survival when they themselves were infected with live bacteria than
   offspring from mothers that had not encountered the bacterium. In a
   detailed temporal examination of the offspring's acute infection phase

   L. splendida) at the same sites. Consistent with the earlier reports,
   invasion-front cane toads travelled further per day, were more highly
   directional, and re-used refuge sites less frequently, than did
   conspecifics from an already-colonized site. In contrast, native frogs
   showed similar movement patterns in the two study areas. Our results
   confirm previous reports, and suggest that accelerated dispersal may be
   a common feature of individuals at the vanguard of a biological

   among the 12 identified in the whole sampling, with a mean abundance of
   parasites higher for A. alosa (167 +/- 10) than for A. fallax (112 +/-
   11). Helminths, mostly trophically transmitted, were the best
   represented (eight taxa, prevalence up to 99\%) in contrast with
   crustaceans and Petromyzontidae that rarely occurred (four taxa,
   prevalence < 6\%). Despite some quantitative differences, metazoan
   parasite communities of A. alosa and A. fallax remained stable in
   composition whatever the host developmental stage, sex, sample site, and
   salinity. Among the nine parasite taxa harbored by each Alosa species,
   six were shared with some differences in distribution patterns including
   in sympatric conditions, suggesting increasing dissimilarities between
   A. alosa and A. fallax with the age. Information on feeding ecology
   provided by trophically transmitted helminths confirmed euryphagous
   opportunistic diet of immatures and adults of both shad species, and

   revealed the significant negative impact of Hemiurus appendiculatus on
   A. alosa and Pronoprymna ventricosa on A. fallax. Because helminth
   parasites are omnipresent in the shads and decrease their fitness,

   in the floral morphology of all woodland star plant species
   (Lithophragma, Saxifragaceae) that are pollinated by Greya (Prodoxidae)
   moths. Flowers of each woodland star species differed depending on
   whether plants interact locally with one, two, or no pollinating moth

   showed few differences in floral traits, suggesting that the geographic
   differences are not due significantly to trait plasticity. Greya moth
   populations also showed significant geographic divergence in morphology,
   depending on the local host and on whether the moth species co-occurred
   locally. Divergence in the plants and the moths involved shifts in
   combinations of partially correlated traits, rather than any one trait.

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{477-483}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) exhibit a wide range of social
   behaviours related to maternal care and nymphal aggregation. Maternal
   care represents an investment in terms of time and energy leading to
   trade-offs which bear a strong relationship with parity and can thus
   affect population dynamics. These trade-offs can be modulated by biotic
   and abiotic features of the oviposition site.
   2. Preliminary observations on Ennya maculicornis (Membracidae:
   Similinae: Polyglyptini) show that females generally lay a single egg
   mass, and occasionally two or three egg masses, and that maternal care
   is a plastic trait because some females abandoned their egg mass before
   it hatched while other females remained with their offspring after egg
   hatching. These features make this species an interesting model to study
   the relationship between female fitness, maternal care and ecological
   factors such as oviposition site.
   3. The biology and natural history of E. maculicornis are described and
   the relationships in question analysed using demographic parameters
   estimated by matrix models. Ennya maculicornis showed sexual dimorphism
   and a longer developmental period than other species of the same tribe.
   Females exhibited maternal care that increased offspring survival, and
   preferred mature over young host leaves for oviposition. Finite rate of
   increase (lambda) values were lower than 1, suggesting a tendency
   towards population decrease.
   4. The results represent the first detailed description of the life
   history and ecology for a species of this genus. Additionally, new
   hypotheses for treehopper sexual dimorphism, oviposition site choice and
   the ecological effects on population dynamics are proposed.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Prior to pupation, lepidopteran larvae enter a wandering phase
   lasting up to 30 h before choosing a pupation site. Because stillness is
   important for concealment, this behaviour calls for an adaptive
   explanation.
   2. The explanation most likely relates to the need to find a suitable
   pupation substrate, especially in terms of shelter from predation, and
   given that many predators and parasitoids use host plants as
   prey-location cues, mortality probably decreases with distance from the
   host plant. Hence, remaining on the host includes a long-term risk,
   while moving away from the host introduces an increased risk during
   locomotion.
   3. Bivoltine species that overwinter in the pupal stage produce two
   kinds of pupae; non-diapausing pupae from which adults emerge after 1-2
   weeks, or diapausing pupae that overwinter with adults emerging after
   8-10 months.
   4. Given the hypothesis of distance-from-host-plant-related predation,
   this should select for phenotypic plasticity with larvae in the
   diapausing generation having a longer wandering phase than larvae under
   direct development, if there is a trade-off between mortality during the
   wandering phase and accumulated mortality during winter.
   5. Here this prediction is tested by studying the duration of the
   wandering period in larvae of the partially bivoltine swallowtail
   butterfly, Papilio machaon, under both developmental pathways.
   6. The results are in agreement with the predictions and show that the
   larval wandering phase is approximately twice as long under diapause
   development. The authors suggest that the longer duration of the
   wandering phase in the diapause generation is a general phenomenon in
   Lepidoptera.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the ecology of water mites in flowing water has focused

   factors acting within the aquatic environment, the formation of

   factors acting in the terrestrial environment. The analysis was made at
   three different levels of organization of the environment: (1) landscape
   level (sub-catchments, terrestrial environment), (2) macrohabitat level
   (sampling sites, aquatic environment) and (3) mesohabitat level
   (sampling sub-sites, aquatic environment). Some correlation was noted
   between certain species and some sub-catchment parameters. This may
   indicate a link between some landscape features (terrestrial
   environment) and the formation of water mite assemblages in the river.
   The low percentage for physicochemical parameters together in explaining
   the variance in occurrence of species, very low correlations between
   species and physicochemical parameters and the discrepancy in the
   grouping of sites in the case of faunal data and data on the
   physicochemical indicates that physicochemical factors had little
   influence on water mites. Taking into account all three levels of
   organization of the environment analyzed, we can say that at the
   landscape level we can find only indirect relationships between
   environmental factors and the fauna inhabiting the aquatic environment;
   at the macrohabitat level the description of Hydrachnidia is more
   precise but still of a general nature. Only analysis at the mesohabitat

Abstract = {{Parasitic species often have detrimental effects on host growth and
   survival. The larvae of the genus Margaritifera (Bivalvia), called
   glochidia, are specialist parasites of salmonid fishes. Previous studies
   have reported negligible influences of the parasite on their salmonid
   hosts at natural infection levels. However, those studies focused mainly
   on their instantaneous effects (i.e., during the parasitic period).
   Given the time lag between physiological and somatic responses to
   pathogen infections, the effect of glochidial infection may become
   clearer during the post-parasitic period. Here, we examined whether the
   effect of glochidial infections of Margaritifera laevis on its salmonid
   host Oncorhynchus masou masou would emerge during the post-parasitic
   period. We performed a controlled aquarium experiment and monitored fish
   growth at two time intervals (i.e., parasitic and post-parasitic
   periods) to test this hypothesis. Consistent with previous observations,
   the effects of glochidial infection were unclear in the middle of the
   experiment (day 50; parasitic period). However, even with a natural
   glochidial load (48 glochidia per fish), we found a significant
   reduction in growth rates of infected fish in the extended period of the
   experiment (day 70; post-parasitic period). Our results suggest that
   examining only instantaneous effects may provide misleading conclusions

Abstract = {{Aim Achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic plants and mycorrhizal fungi often
   have highly specific interactions that potentially limit the plants'
   distribution and diversification potential. However, specificity in
   biotic interactions may differ considerably over a species' distribution
   range and therefore interactions need to be studied over their entire
   range to assess their evolution in space and time. The present study
   investigates the biogeographical history of the interaction between five
   closely related mycoheterotrophic Thismia species and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi over the distribution range of the plant species.
   Location Temperate south-east Australia and New Zealand.
   Methods Phylogenetic relationships of Thismia (nrITS and mtcob) and
   their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (partial nrSSU) were reconstructed
   based on data from 65 plant specimens. The diversification times in
   Thismia were estimated with a Bayesian relaxed clock approach using a
   Dioscoreales framework (nrSSU, mtatp1, mtmatR, mtnad1 b-c). Ancestral
   geographical ranges were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood
   approach. The same approach was used to reconstruct ancestral
   mycorrhizal associations.
   Results Our analysis shows that Thismia plants have highly specific,
   phylogenetically conserved and evolutionarily persistent interactions
   with Rhizophagus fungi. Nevertheless, Thismia was able to diversify and
   radiate recently due to the wide geographical distribution of the host
   fungi. In addition, we find that although the mycorrhizal interactions
   of this clade of mycoheterotrophs are strictly bound to a fungal
   lineage, host switches remain possible.
   Main conclusions In this clade of closely related mycoheterotrophs,
   dependency on highly specific fungal interactions is the result of
   phylogenetic niche conservatism, acting over at least 12 million years.
   Nevertheless, plants that are dependent on highly specific fungal
   interactions have ample opportunities to disperse and radiate over the
   geographical range of their hosts. Our study highlights the need to link
   the ecology and evolution of species interactions over broad
   geographical and evolutionary scales for understanding mycorrhizal
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Anthelmintics are widely used to control gastrointestinal parasites of
   livestock. However, the residues of these compounds, particularly the
   macrocyclic lactones, are excreted largely unmetabolised in faeces,
   where they may have toxic effects on dung-colonising insects.
   Impoverishment of the coprophagous beetle community impairs the process
   of dung recycling and, as a result, may enhance the persistence of
   dung-dwelling helminth parasitic stages. To test this possibility, a
   large-scale field trial was conducted in south-west England. The
   availability of infective parasite helminth larvae (L-3) was
   investigated on the herbage around 240 artificial 1-kg dung pats that
   had been constructed from the faeces of beef cattle with naturally
   acquired strongyle infections. Herbage up to 15cm surrounding each pat
   was sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10weeks after deposition. Pats were
   subject to enhanced, natural or no dung beetle colonisation and
   uncontrolled or enhanced rainfall. Under uncontrolled rainfall
   conditions, 2weeks after pat deposition, significantly more L-3 were
   recovered from around pats that were exposed to beetle colonisation than
   from pats that were not colonised. However, by week 8, significantly
   fewer L-3 were recovered from around pats that were exposed to beetle
   colonisation compared to uncolonised pats. Under conditions of enhanced
   rainfall, pats yielded significantly more L-3 than under uncontrolled
   rainfall conditions, and there were no differences in recovery from
   herbage around pats with enhanced, natural or no beetle colonisation.
   The data suggest that over the duration of a summer grazing season,
   temperate habitat dung-colonising insect communities, which include
   mainly small endocoprid dung beetles of the genus Aphodius, can reduce
   the development and survival of livestock gastrointestinal parasites on
   pastures, but that this can be overridden by the effect of high
   rainfall.Synthesis and applications. The work demonstrates that
   conservation of dung beetle populations in temperate climates is
   important in livestock management, not only for their essential role in
   dung degradation and nutrient cycling, but because their activity can
   also reduce the survival and availability of gastrointestinal parasites
   on pastures.

Abstract = {{The leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is one
   of the most damaging agricultural pests in the Neotropics. Management
   strategies predominantly rely on the use of general insecticides. What

   options. Parasitioids such as phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae) may be
   one such option, but a greater understanding of the ecology of the flies
   and their ant hosts is essential to devise biological control
   strategies. Here we report parasitism rates, ant host size, parasitoid
   abundance per host and resultant sex ratios of two phorid species
   Apocephalus attophilus Borgmeier and Eibesfeldtphora tonhascai Brown
   parasitizing A.sexdens. The two species achieved parasitism rates of
   1.48 and 1.46\%, respectively and the pupal period was 14.7 +/- 1.1 days
   and 22.1 +/- 2.8 days, respectively. There was no significant difference
   between the head capsule width of ants parasitized by either A.
   attophilus or E. tonhascai. Likewise, there was no significant effect
   between the head capsule width of parasitized and unparasitized ants for
   both species. A significant positive correlation was found between the
   head capsule width of the parasitized ants and the number of adult
   parasitoids A. attophilus emerged. Ants parasitized by E. tonhascai
   survived significantly longer than those parasitized by A. attophilus.
   There was no significant effect of ant head width on the sex ratio of
   the offspring of either parasitoid species and no significant difference
   in the sex ratio (male: female) of their offspring. In summary, these

Abstract = {{Opisthorchis viverrini (Dv) is one of the most important human parasitic
   diseases in Southeast Asia. Although the concept of connectivity is
   widely used to comprehend disease dispersal, knowledge of the influences
   of landscape connectivity on Ov transmission is still rudimentary. This
   study aimed to investigate the role of landscape connectivity in Ov
   transmission between the human and the first intermediate snail hosts.
   Fieldwork was conducted in three villages respectively in Kamalasai
   District, Kalasin Province, Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province, and
   Nong Saeng District, Udon Thani Province. Bithynia snails were collected
   to examine parasitic infections, water samples were analyzed for fecal
   contamination, and locations of septic tanks and connections between
   habitat patches with observable water movement were surveyed. Euclidean
   distance, topological link and distance, and graph measures were
   employed to quantify the connectivity between human and snail habitats.
   The findings showed that snail patches with higher fecal contents were
   generally located nearer to septic tanks. The statistically significant
   results for the topological link and distance measures highlighted the
   importance of water in functionally facilitating Ov transmission. Graph
   measures revealed differences in landscape connectivity across the
   sites. The site with the largest landscape component size and the most
   mutually connected snail patches coincided with the presence of Ov
   parasite, reinforcing its higher risk for human to snail transmission.
   The site with the dissected landscape structure potentially limited the
   transmission. This study underscored the potential effect of landscape
   connectivity on Ov transmission, contributing to the understanding of
   the spatial variation of Ov infection risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Aim: Although there is a vast body of literature on the causes of

   functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better
   understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we investigate
   whether species interactions vary more in response to different climate
   variables than do individual species.
   Location: Eurasia.
   Time period: 2000s.
   Major taxa: Animalia.
   Methods: We used a measure of local contribution to beta-diversity to
   evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host-parasite communities of
   rodents and their ectoparasitic fleas across Eurasia, using publicly
   available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition
   and based on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
   host-parasite interactions).
   Results: We show that species interactions vary more, across space, than
   do species. In particular, we show that species interactions respond to
   some climatic variables that have no effect on species distributions or
   dissimilarity.
   Main conclusions: Species interactions capture some degree of variation
   that is not apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this
   system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in different
   ways as a response to different environmental factors, especially the
   temperature and dryness. We discuss the implications of this finding for
   the amount of information that should be considered when measuring

   correlated to microbe density, confounding the strength of an immune
   response and resistance to parasites. In this study, we analyse these
   relationships in an mRNA-seq time series of Tribolium castaneum infected
   with Bacillus thuringiensis. Our results suggest that many extracellular
   immunological components with known roles in immunity, like
   antimicrobial peptides and recognition proteins, are highly correlated
   to microbe load. On the other hand, intracellular components of
   immunological signalling pathways overwhelmingly show non-monotonic
   temporal patterns of gene expression, despite the underlying assumption
   of monotonicity in most ecological and comparative transcriptomics
   studies that rely on cross-sectional analyses. Our results raise a host
   of new questions, including to what extent variation in host resistance,
   infection tolerance and immunopathology can be explained by variation in
   the slope or sensitivity of these newly characterized patterns.}},

   between rival parasitoids}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Insects use endogenous mechanisms and infection with protective
   symbionts to thwart attacks from natural enemies. Defenses that target
   specific enemies, however, potentially mediate competition between
   rivals and thereby impact community composition. Following its
   introduction to North America to control pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon
   pisum), the parasitoid Aphidius ervi competitively displaced other
   parasitoids, except for the native Praon pequodorum. The pea aphid
   exhibits tremendous clonal variation in resistance to A. ervi, primarily
   through infection with the heritable bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella
   defensa, although some symbiont-free aphid genotypes encode endogenous
   resistance. Interestingly, H. defensa strains and aphid genotypes that
   protect against A. ervi, provide no protection against the closely
   related, P. pequodorum. Given the specificity of aphid defenses, we
   hypothesized that aphid resistance traits may contribute to the
   continued persistence of P. pequodorum. We conducted multiparasitism
   assays to determine whether aphid resistance traits mediate internal
   competition between these two solitary parasitoid species, but found
   this was not the case; P. pequodorum was the successful internal
   competitor across lines varying in susceptibility to A. ervi. Next, to
   determine whether resistance traits influence competitive interactions
   resulting in the stable persistence of P. pequodorum, we established
   replicated cages varying in the proportion of resistant aphids and
   recorded successful parasitism for each wasp species over time. As
   expected, A. ervi outcompeted P. pequodorum in cages containing only
   susceptible aphids. However, P. pequodorum not only persisted, but was
   the superior competitor in populations containing any proportion
   (20-100\%) of resistant aphids (20-100\%). Smaller scale, better
   replicated competition cage studies corroborated this finding, and
   no-competition and behavioral assays provide insight into the processes
   mediating competition. Genetic variation, including that acquired via
   infection with protective symbionts, may provide a supply of hosts
   susceptible only to particular enemies, mediating competition with
   effects on community richness and stability.}},

Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring health in wild great apes is integral to their conservation
   and is especially important where they share habitats with humans, given
   the potential for zoonotic pathogen exchange. We studied the intestinal
   parasites of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii)
   inhabiting degraded forest fragments amid farmland and villages in
   Bulindi, Uganda. We first identified protozoan and helminth parasites
   infecting this population. Sixteen taxa were demonstrated
   microscopically (9 protozoa, 5 nematodes, 1 cestode, and 1 trematode).
   DNA sequence analysis enabled more precise identification of larval
   nematodes (e.g. Oesophagostomum stephanostomum, O. bifurcum,
   Strongyloides fuelleborni, Necator sp. Type II) and tapeworm proglottids
   (genus Bertiella). To better understand the ecology of infections, we
   used multidimensional scaling analysis to reveal general patterns of
   association among parasites, climate, and whole leaf swallowing -a
   prevalent self-medicative behaviour at Bulindi linked to control of
   nodular worms (Oesophagostomum spp.). Prevalence of parasites varied
   with climate in diverse ways. For example, Oesophagostomum sp. was
   detected in faeces at higher frequencies with increasing rainfall but
   was most clearly associated with periods of low temperature. Certain
   parasites occurred together within chimpanzee hosts more or less
   frequently than expected by chance. For example, the commensal ciliate
   Troglodytella abrassarti was negatively associated with Balantidium coli
   and Oesophagostomum sp., possibly because the latter taxa make the large
   intestine less suitable for T. abrassarti. Whole leaves in faeces showed
   independent associations with the prevalence of Oesophagostomum sp.,
   Strongyloides sp., and hookworm by microscopic examination, and with
   egestion of adult O. stephanostomum by macroscopic inspection. All
   parasites identified to species or genus have been reported in wild
   chimpanzees inhabiting less-disturbed environments than Bulindi.
   Nevertheless, several disease- causing taxa infecting these chimpanzees
   are potentially transmissible between apes and humans (e.g. rhabditoid
   and strongyle nematodes), underscoring the importance of identifying and
   reducing risks of pathogen exchange in shared landscapes.}},

   transmission capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes: a habitat manipulation
   experiment}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: A neglected aspect of alien invasive plant species is their
   influence on mosquito vector ecology and malaria transmission. Invasive
   plants that are highly attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes provide them
   with sugar that is critical to their survival. The effect on Anopheles
   mosquito populations was examined through a habitat manipulation
   experiment that removed the flowering branches of highly attractive
   Prosopis juliflora from selected villages in Mali, West Africa.
   Methods: Nine villages in the Bandiagara district of Mali were selected,
   six with flowering Prosopis juliflora, and three without. CDC-UV light
   traps were used to monitor their Anopheles spp. vector populations, and
   recorded their species composition, population size, age structure, and
   sugar feeding status. After 8 days, all of the flowering branches were
   removed from three villages and trap catches were analysed again.
   Results: Villages where flowering branches of the invasive shrub
   Prosopis juliflora were removed experienced a threefold drop in the
   older more dangerous Anopheles females. Population density dropped by
   69.4\% and the species composition shifted from being a mix of three
   species of the Anopheles gambiae complex to one dominated by Anopheles
   coluzzii. The proportion of sugar fed females dropped from 73 to 15\%
   and males from 77 to 10\%.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates how an invasive plant shrub
   promotes the malaria parasite transmission capacity of African malaria
   vector mosquitoes. Proper management of invasive plants could
   potentially reduce mosquito populations and malaria transmission.}},

Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{The coevolutionary interactions between avian brood parasites and their
   hosts provide a powerful system for investigating the diversity of
   animal coloration. Specifically, reciprocal selection pressure applied
   by hosts and brood parasites can give rise to novel forms and functions
   of animal coloration, which largely differ from those that arise when
   selection is imposed by predators or mates. In the study of animal
   colours, avian brood parasite-host dynamics therefore invite special
   consideration. Rapid advances across disciplines have paved the way for
   an integrative study of colour and vision in brood parasite-host
   systems. We now know that visually driven host defences and host life
   history have selected for a suite of phenotypic adaptations in
   parasites, including mimicry, crypsis and supernormal stimuli. This
   sometimes leads to vision-based host counter-adaptations and increased
   parasite trickery. Here, we review vision-based adaptations that arise
   in parasite-host interactions, emphasizing that these adaptations can be
   visual/sensory, cognitive or phenotypic in nature. We highlight recent
   breakthroughs in chemistry, genomics, neuroscience and computer vision,
   and we conclude by identifying important future directions. Moving
   forward, it will be essential to identify the genetic and neural bases
   of adaptation and to compare vision-based adaptations to those arising
   in other sensory modalities.

   explaining extra-pair paternity using a comparative approach based on
   the microsatellite genotypes of 2049 individuals from 510 plover

   Extra-pair paternity rates were very low (0 to 4.1\% of chicks per

   extra-pair paternity (EPP). The low prevalence of EPP is consistent with
   a number of alternative hypotheses, including the parental investment

Abstract = {{In ecology, diversity is often measured as the mean rarity of species in
   a community. In behavioral sciences and parasitology, mean crowding is
   the size of the group to which a typical individual belongs. In this
   paper, focusing mostly on the mathematical aspect, we demonstrate that
   diversity and crowding are closely related notions. We show that mean
   crowding can be transformed into diversity and vice versa. Based on this
   general equivalence rule, notions, relationships, and methods developed
   in one field can be adapted to the other one. In relation to crowding,
   we introduce the notion ``effective number of groups{''} that
   corresponds to the ``effective number of species{''} used in diversity
   studies. We define new aggregation indices that mirror evenness indices
   known from diversity theory. We also construct aggregation profiles and
   orderings of populations based on aggregation indices. By uniting the
   mathematical interpretation of the ecological notion of diversity and
   the ethological notion of typical group size (or crowding, in
   parasitology), our insight opens a new avenue of both theoretical and

   with intermediate exposed culmen length (11.6 +/- 0.5 mm) and wing chord
   length similar to the other two migratory subspecies (62.7 +/- 1.5 mm).
   Territory size for A. s. ammolegus was 0.72 +/- 0.37 ha, with some
   variation between sites and among years, possibly indicating variation
   in habitat quality across spatial and temporal scales. The return rate
   for A. s. ammolegus males was 39.2\%. Nest initiation for A. s.
   ammolegus was early to mid-July after the monsoons had begun. Domed
   nests were constructed on the ground, primarily under native bunch
   grasses, and frequently with a tunnel extending beyond the nest rim,
   with nest openings oriented north. Clutch size was 3.97 +/- 0.68, with
   no evidence of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) nest parasitism.
   Extreme climate factors in the arid Southwest may have affected the life
   history and morphology of A. s. ammolegus as compared to other
   subspecies, influencing body size and mass, culmen length, breeding
   phenology, and nest orientation. Other geographic variation occurred in
   return rates, clutch size, and nest parasitism rates. The baseline data
   for A. s. ammolegus obtained in this study will inform future taxonomic

Abstract = {{1. Coinfections are increasingly recognized as important drivers of
   disease dynamics. Consequently, greater emphasis has been placed on
   integrating principles from community ecology with disease ecology to
   understand within-host interactions among parasites. Using larval
   amphibians and two amphibian parasites (ranaviruses and the trematode
   Echinoparyphium sp.), we examined the influence of coinfection on
   disease outcomes.
   2. Our first objective was to examine how priority effects (the timing
   and sequence of parasite exposure) influence infection and disease
   outcomes in the laboratory. We found that interactions between the
   parasites were asymmetric; prior infection with Echinoparyphium reduced
   ranaviral loads by 9\% but there was no reciprocal effect of prior
   ranavirus infection on Echinoparyphium load. Additionally, survival
   rates of hosts (larval gray treefrogs; Hyla versicolor) infected with
   Echinoparyphium 10 days prior to virus exposure were 25\% greater
   compared to hosts only exposed to virus.
   3. Our second objective was to determine whether these patterns were
   generalizable to multiple amphibian species under more natural
   conditions. We conducted a semi-natural mesocosm experiment consisting
   of four larval amphibian hosts {[}gray treefrogs, American toads
   (Anaxyrus americanus), leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and spring

   ranavirus-infected larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) as source
   of ranavirus. Consistent with the laboratory experiment, we found that

   reduce microparasite replication rates across multiple amphibian
   species, possibly through cross-reactive immunity. Although the
   immunological mechanisms driving this outcome are in need of further
   study, trematode infections appear to benefit hosts that are exposed to
   ranaviruses. Additionally, these results suggest that consideration of
   priority effects and timing of exposure are vital for understanding
   parasite interactions within hosts and disease outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Avian brood parasitism provides a tractable system within which to study
   diverse aspects of animal ecology and evolution. Yet, parasite-host
   research has focused on specific adaptations and counter-adaptations,
   such as egg rejection by hosts and egg mimicry by parasites, leaving
   other aspects of these relationships poorly studied, including general
   life history traits of hosts that did not evolve as specific
   antiparasite defenses. In particular, the diet and fledging parameters
   (age, mass, success) of parasitic nestlings are poorly known, although
   they are central to our understanding of host selection and the
   potential for coevolution in parasite-host relationships. We focused on
   the diet composition and fledging parameters of parasitic Common Cuckoo
   (Cuculus canorus) nestlings raised by their only regular cavity-nesting
   host, the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus). In addition to
   invertebrates, both Common Cuckoo and Common Redstart nestlings were fed
   fruits and lizards by some host pairs. This is the first record of
   lizards being fed to Common Cuckoo nestlings by any host. Capitalizing
   on this unusual diet and between-host-pair variation (statistically
   confirmed by high repeatability of diet composition across host pairs),
   we tested for the first time whether nestling diet variation affected
   Common Cuckoo breeding success. Common Cuckoos, but not Common
   Redstarts, fed a combination of plants and vertebrates showed decreased
   fledging masses and delayed fledging. Common Cuckoos fed with plants
   (but not vertebrates) also had lower fledging masses. Vertebrates alone
   did not have any effects. Fledging success was not influenced. These
   patterns could not be explained by various potential confounding
   effects, including seasonal effects or inferior provisioning capacities
   of Common Redstarts feeding unusual diets. This suggests that plant and
   vertebrate material is digestible by Common Cuckoo nestlings but might
   cause ontogenetic stress. We show for the first time that diet
   composition may affect parasite success, not only at the level of host
   species, as documented by previous studies, but also intraspecifically
   (i.e. at the level of individual host pairs). Host diet selection may
   represent an important general life history trait that affects brood
   parasite fitness, even though it most likely did not evolve as a
   specific antiparasite defense.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrids and their parasite diversity represent interesting models for
   evolutionary ecology. The modified immune response, shifted ecology,
   inheritance, and maternal ancestry of hybrid host fish are supposed to
   affect the diversity of their parasite communities. The pattern of
   metazoan parasite distribution in non congeneric cyprinids - common
   bream (Abramis brama) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) (species with
   different morphology and ecology, and harbouring different specific
   parasites) - and their hybrids was analysed. Four static alternative
   scenarios based on parasite infection levels in hybrids and parental
   taxa are known. The hybrid resistance scenario predicts that hybrids are
   more resistant than parental taxa, resulting in low parasite infection
   in hybrids. This scenario is principally consistent with hybrid
   heterosis advantage. In accordance with this prediction, metazoan
   parasite abundance and prevalence were higher in parental species when
   compared with their hybrids. Alternatively, the dynamic Red Queen
   scenario of infection in hybridising systems predicts parasite
   adaptation to common hosts. Temporal (six sampling events) and spatial
   (two sampling sites) aspects as possible factors influencing parasite
   distribution were analysed. We found no support for this hypothesis,
   i.e. no changes in the frequency of hybrids or their parental species
   and no changes in parasite infection in parental species or hybrids were
   found in the different time periods. The effect of maternal ancestry on
   infection level was evident; hybrids exhibiting common bream mtDNA were
   more strongly parasitized by digeneans and crustaceans than hybrids
   exhibiting roach mtDNA. Hybrids harboured a majority of the specific
   parasites of both parental species; however, the level of infection of
   common bream-specific parasites (especially monogeneans) in hybrids was
   low. Such an asymmetrical distribution of parental species-specific
   parasites in hybrids may suggest the limited inheritance of protective
   immunological mechanisms from one parental species and reveal stronger
   coadaptation between common bream and its specific parasites. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Parasites are ubiquitous throughout nature and can have dramatic effects
   on their hosts. Although much is known about the pathology of parasites,
   the environmental factors influencing the distribution and abundance of
   parasites are poorly understood. Investigations into these factors could
   help predict the effect of parasites on the functioning of ecosystems.
   The limpet Patella vulgata is a key grazer on European rocky shores and
   is the first intermediate host for the trematode parasite,
   Echinostephilla patellae. This study investigated the spatial
   distribution of E. patellae in relation to P. vulgata at fourteen rocky
   shores around Ireland. Despite P. vulgata recruiting into rock pools,
   adults are more abundant on emergent rock and experience greater
   mortality in pools compared to emergent rock. It has been suggested that
   greater parasite prevalence in pools may be a factor driving this
   disjunct distribution pattern. Prevalence of infection was compared
   among rock and pool habitats. Size and sex of the host were also
   investigated in order to determine whether host phenotype influenced
   levels of infection prevalence. Results varied considerably among study
   sites, probably due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. No
   clear pattern emerged in relation to infection prevalence between
   habitats but this may be owing to the low numbers of limpets collected
   from pools. There was a significant positive relationship between
   infection prevalence and increasing host size. Individuals for which sex
   was indeterminate were more likely to be infected than distinct males or
   females, suggesting that infection may be causing castration and
   subsequent removal of these individuals from the breeding population. We

Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss can alter disease transmission; however, the magnitude

   loss of large wildlife, on infection probability, intensity and
   population size of a group of common rodent-borne parasites -
   macroparasitic helminths. Consistent with previous work on vector-borne
   pathogens, we found that large wildlife removal causes strong and
   systematic increases of rodent-borne parasites, largely due to increases
   in rodent density, as rodents are released from competition with larger
   herbivores. Although we predicted that increased host density would also
   increase per capita infection among all directly transmitted parasites,
   this additional amplification occurred for only two of three examined
   parasites. Furthermore, the actual effects of large mammal loss on per
   capita infection were mediated by the complex suite of abiotic and
   biotic factors that regulate parasite transmission. Thus, while these
   results strongly suggest that large wildlife loss will cause systematic
   increases in rodent parasite populations, they also underscore the
   difficulty of making more specific predictions for a given parasite

   2. Direct responses of aquatic ecosystems to the disturbance include

   responses such as turbidity, oxygen depletion and foodweb alteration; a
   phenomenon known as anthropogenic eutrophication. Ultimately,
   eutrophication causes a wide range of effects on host-parasite

   probability and outcome in disturbed areas.
   3. Future research should encompass a more fundamental and holistic view

Abstract = {{Plants can defend themselves against herbivores through activation of
   defensive pathways and attraction of third-trophic-level predators and
   parasites. Trophic cascades that mediate interactions in the phytobiome
   are part of a larger dynamic including the pathogens of the plant
   itself, which are known to greatly influence plant defenses. As such, we
   investigated the impact of a phloem-limited bacterial pathogen,
   Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), in cultivated citrus rootstock
   on a well-studied belowground tritrophic interaction involving the
   attraction of an entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), Steinernema
   diaprepesi, to their root-feeding insect hosts, Diaprepes abbreviatus
   larvae. Using belowground olfactometers, we show how CLas infection
   interferes with this belowground interaction by similarly inducing the
   release of a C12 terpene, pregeijerene, and disconnecting the
   association of the terpene with insect presence. D. abbreviatus larvae
   that were not feeding but in the presence of a CLas-infected plant were
   more likely to be infected by EPN than those near uninfected plants.
   Furthermore, nonfeeding larvae associated with CLas-infected plants were
   just as likely to be infected by EPN as those near noninfected plants
   with D. abbreviatus larval damage. Larvae of two weevil species, D.
   abbreviatus and Pachnaeus litus, were also more attracted to plants with
   infection than to uninfected plants. D. abbreviatus larvae were most
   active when exposed to pregeijerene at a concentration of 0.1 mu g/mu l.
   We attribute this attraction to CLas-infected plants to the same signal
   previously thought to be a herbivore-induced plant volatile specifically
   induced by root-feeding insects, pregeijerene, by assessing volatiles
   collected from the roots of infected plants and uninfected plants with
   and without feeding D. abbreviatus. Synthesis. Phytopathogens can
   influence the structuring of soil communities extending to the third

   host-finding using pregeijerene as a cue in citrus grove agroecosystems

   2. In Mississippi floodplain forests, larval L. elaphus were recovered

   vertebrata (Say) (Diptera: Tachinidae).
   3. Flight intercept traps placed at three heights at both the edge and

   L. elaphus, all of which were captured in traps placed at 15 m on the
   forest edge.
   4. Because L. elaphus larvae are morphologically indistinguishable from
   related species, DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome

   Genetic data revealed modest intra-specific variation, with up to 1.3\%

   These two Charadriiformes species exhibit striking differences in MHC-I
   characteristics and MHC-I diversity. We therefore set out to study a
   third species within Charadriiformes, the Icelandic subspecies of
   black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa islandica). This subspecies is

   low MHC diversity. MHC-I was partially characterized first using Sanger

Abstract = {{Although local prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis may be high,
   this zoonotic parasite has an overall low prevalence in foxes and
   rodents in Sweden. To better understand opportunities for E.
   multilocularis transmission in the Swedish environment, the aim of this
   study was to investigate other taeniid cestodes and to relate observed
   patterns to E. multilocularis. Cestode parasites were examined in fox
   feces and rodents caught in different habitats from four regions of
   Sweden. Arvicola amphibius and Microtus agrestis were parasitized with
   Versteria mustelae, Hydatigera taeniaeformis s.l., and E.
   multilocularis, whereas Myodes glareolus and Apodemus spp. were
   parasitized with V. mustelae, Taenia polyacantha, H. taeniaeformis s.l.,
   and Mesocestoides spp. Rodents caught in field habitat (Ar. amphibius,
   Mi. agrestis) were more likely (OR 10, 95\% CI 5-19) to be parasitized
   than rodents caught in forest habitat (My. glareolus, Apodemus spp.).
   The parasite preference for each rodent species was present regardless
   of the type of background contamination from fox feces. These results
   further support the importance of both ecological barriers and
   individual species susceptibility in parasite transmission, and indicate
   that future monitoring for E. multilocularis in the Swedish environment
   should focus in field habitats where Mi. agrestis and Ar. amphibius are
   abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites reduce host fitness via perturbations to host energy
   allocation, growth, survival, and reproduction. Here, we investigate the
   independent effects of parasite exposure and infection on host metabolic
   rate. Our study focuses on Drosophila hydei and a naturally occurring
   ectoparasitic mite, Macrocheles muscaedomesticae. We use flow-through
   respirometry to measure the metabolic rate of flies during the period of
   exposure (preinfection) and during mite attachment. Flies were exposed
   to mites either indirectly (through a mesh screen) or directly, allowing
   for physical contact between the fly and the mite. We predicted that fly
   metabolic rate would increase with the level of parasite exposure:
   unexposed flies < flies with indirect exposure to mites < flies with
   direct contact with mites < flies actively infected with mites. As
   expected, flies indirectly exposed to but not in direct contact with
   mites produced 70\% more CO2 than unexposed flies. Flies in direct
   contact with mites produced 35\% more CO2 than flies with indirect
   contact, and this was more than double the amount of CO2 produced by
   unexposed flies. However, infected flies-those actually carrying
   mites-did not produce significantly more CO2 than uninfected flies. Our
   results show that simply being exposed to mites, either indirectly or
   directly, was sufficient to elicit a response from the host in terms of
   elevated CO2 production. Our results show that the costs of parasitism
   can potentially extend beyond the physiological costs of infection per
   se to include the energetic costs associated with parasite avoidance.
   Although studies have shown energetic costs associate with
   predator-avoidance behaviors, no study to our knowledge has measured the
   metabolic cost of parasite avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{I used radio-telemetry to track the movements of Mangrove Cuckoos

   VHF radio-transmitters to 32 individuals between 2012 and 2015, and
   obtained a sufficient number of relocations from 16 of them to estimate
   home-range boundaries and describe patterns of movement. Home-range area
   varied widely among individuals, but in general was roughly four times
   larger than expected based on the body size of Mangrove Cuckoos. The
   median core area (50\% isopleth) of a home range was 42 ha (range: 9-91
   ha), and the median overall home range (90\% isopleth) was 128 ha
   (range: 28-319 ha). The median distance between estimated locations
   recorded on subsequent days was 298 m (95\% CI {[}187 m-409 m]), but
   variation within and among individuals was substantial, and it was not
   uncommon to relocate individuals >1 km from their location on the

   Mangrove Cuckoos were present year-round within the study area, I did
   not observe any individuals that remained on a single home range
   throughout the year. Although individual birds showed no evidence of
   avoiding anthropogenic edges, they did not incorporate developed areas
   into their daily movements and home ranges consisted almost entirely of
   mangrove forest. The persistence of the species in the study area
   depended on a network of conserved lands-mostly public, but some
   privately conserved land as well-because large patches of mangrove
   forest did not occur on tracts left unprotected from development.}},

Abstract = {{Hematodinium perezi causes disease and mortality in several decapod
   crustaceans along the eastern seaboard and Gulf coast of the USA. The
   route of transmission of the parasite is unknown, but infections exhibit
   a sharp seasonal cycle in its primary host, the blue crab Call-inectes
   sapidus, that indicates the possibility of a short transmission period
   in its life cycle. We developed a sentinel methodology based on the use
   of naive, uninfected, early benthic juvenile crabs (instars C1 to C10)
   to investigate the transmission of H. perezi. Crabs were collected from
   a non-endemic site, held for a short period for evaluation, and then
   deployed in a highly endemic site for 14 d. Transmission of the pathogen
   was successful; 12.7 to 25.7\% of the crabs deployed at the endemic site
   became infected over this period. Infections developed rapidly, with
   25\% of new infections developing into heavy infections during the
   deployment. The large number of infections that developed using the
   sentinel methodology allowed for the first estimates of incidence (the
   proportion of new infections in a population over time) in this system.
   Incidence varied from 0.9 to 1.8\% of the resident crab population per
   day and accounts for the high prevalence levels observed in the endemic
   coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula. The development of this sentinel
   methodology has broad application for studying disease ecology in this

   cheaters affect the stability of antibiotic producing and degrading

   degradation cheaters. We generalize the mixed inhibition-zone and

   cost of producing these antibiotics. Degradation cheaters, mutants that
   loose their function of producing extracellular antibiotic degrading
   molecules, induce community collapse only if the cost of producing the
   degradation factors is above a critical level. Our analytical studies,

   antibiotic producing and degrading communities to loss-of-function

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{394}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Mistletoes rely on biotic seed dispersal to ensure their recruitment on
   appropriate host plants, as their seeds must be deposited on safe sites
   to allow attachment. As most host-parasite systems, mistletoe's spatial
   distribution depends on the spatial arrangement of the hosts and on the
   seed disperser's behavior. We used the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus,
   which is solely dispersed by the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops
   gliroides, and it is capable to parasitize a wide range of hosts. We
   previously found T. corymbosus mistletoes to be more abundant and
   densely aggregated in disturbed habitats, compared to neigh-boring
   native forests, at similar levels of disperser abundance and host
   availability. To explain this pattern, we tested two non-mutually
   exclusive hypotheses: (1) the larger resource availability in disturbed
   habitats modify the disperser behavior reducing its home range, and (2)
   plant species in disturbed habitats are better hosts and offer higher
   survival probabilities. We sampled 300 mistletoes (98 at the native
   forest and 202 at the disturbed habitat), which were followed from
   November 2011 to March 2015 for estimating survival rates and conducting
   point-pattern analyses. Besides, we tracked ten Dromiciops gliroides
   individuals using VHF telemetry at both habitats to estimate the home
   range areas in the two habitats. Mistletoes were aggregated in both
   habitat types, being stronger at the disturbed habitat with dense plant
   clumps. Besides, no differences were found on home range of individual
   D. gliroides between habitats despite structural and resource
   availability differences. However, mistletoe survival significantly
   differed between habitats, as mistletoes had a survival probability of
   82.87\% at the disturbed habitat, whereas survival probability at the
   non-disturbed habitat was 53.33\%. The most common host species at the
   non-disturbed habitat is Pluchea absinthioides, a seasonal shrub where
   mistletoes had a survival probability of 29\%. At the disturbed habitat,
   however, the most common hosts are the shade-intolerant shrubs
   Aristotelia chilensis and Rhaphithamnus spinosus, which had very low
   mortality rates. The aggregation pattern found at the disturbed habitat
   is likely to emerge from differential host mortality rather than
   behavioral changes on the seed disperser vector. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{64}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Polystomatid monogeneans have a wide diversity of life cycles correlated
   with the varied ecology and behaviour of their aquatic vertebrate hosts.
   Typically, transmission involves a swimming infective larva but most
   hosts are amphibious and invasion is interrupted when hosts leave water.
   A key life cycle adaptation involves a uterus that, in the most
   specialised cases, may contain several hundred fully-developed larvae
   prepared for instant host-to-host transmission. By contrast, one
   subfamily of the Polystomatidae - the Polystomoidinae, specific to
   chelonians (freshwater turtles) - has a simplified reproductive system
   without a uterus. Recently, Polystomoides nelsoni Du Preez et Van
   Rooyen, 2015 has been described with a uterus containing multiple eggs.
   The present study explores the exceptional interest of this parasite -
   for the functional biology of egg production, for the evolution of a
   reproductive system unique amongst ca 60 species in the subfamily, and
   for systematic relationships. A new genus is proposed,
   Uteropolystomoides gen. n., separate from the four currently-recognised
   genera Polystomoides Ward, 1917, Uropolystomoides Tinsley et Tinsley,
   2016, Neopolystoma Price, 1939 and Polystomoidella Price, 1939 which
   lack a uterus. In addition, U. nelsoni (Du Preez et Van Rooyen, 2015)
   comb. n. has a suite of distinctive copulatory stuctures: a massive
   genital bulb with an exceptionally large number of very long genital
   spines and hyper-development of the vaginal openings. These characters
   set U. nelsoni apart from all other polystomoidines worldwide except
   Polystomoides multifalx Stunkard, 1924 and P. stunkardi Harwood, 1931.
   Missing data for these latter species preclude definitive assessment of
   inter-relationships but the distinguishing characters of U. nelsoni,
   especially the unique occurrence of the uterus, suggest a novel
   evolutionary pathway isolated from other lineages of polystomatids
   infecting chelonians.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is one of the
   key strategic targets advanced by the Sustainable Development Goals.
   Despite the unprecedented effort deployed for NTD elimination in the
   past decade, their control, mainly through drug administration, remains
   particularly challenging: persistent poverty and repeated exposure to
   pathogens embedded in the environment limit the efficacy of strategies
   focused exclusively on human treatment or medical care. Here, we present
   a simple modelling framework to illustrate the relative role of
   ecological and socio-economic drivers of environmentally transmitted
   parasites and pathogens. Through the analysis of system dynamics, we
   show that periodic drug treatments that lead to the elimination of
   directly transmitted diseases may fail to do so in the case of human
   pathogens with an environmental reservoir. Control of environmentally
   transmitted diseases can be more effective when human treatment is
   complemented with interventions targeting the environmental reservoir of
   the pathogen. We present mechanisms through which the environment can
   influence the dynamics of poverty via disease feedbacks. For
   illustration, we present the case studies of Buruli ulcer and
   schistosomiasis, two devastating waterborne NTDs for which control is
   particularly challenging.

   formulations of PHA used in ecological studies, with potentially
   differing outcomes that could produce inconsistent results. We tested
   two common types of PHA in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) to
   identify local and systemic immune responses underlying the resultant
   swelling at 6, 18, 24, and 48 hr post injection. There were differences
   in both local (injection site) and systemic (blood) leukocyte responses
   to PHA-L versus PHA-P. PHA-P injection produced a greater overall
   increase in local heterophil count at the injection site compared with
   PHA-L, and this response was greatest at 6 and 24 hr post injection.
   Systemically, heterophil percentage was higher in the blood of
   PHA-P-versus PHA-L-injected anoles at 24 hr post injection; the time
   point at which heterophil percentage peaked in PHA-P-injected anoles.
   These results indicate that although both PHA types are effective tests

   a much stronger heterophilic response. PHA-L is a more specific test of
   lymphocyte function, particularly at 24 hr post injection, making it
   preferable for ecoimmunology studies.}},

Abstract = {{Root hemiparasites are green plants which attach to roots of other

   associations of hemiparasitic plants growing in natural conditions.
   Direct examination of host associations is only possible at sites with
   specific soil types (e.g. sandy substrates) that allow host roots to be
   traced to the shoot to identify the host species. We investigated the
   possibility of using a DNA barcoding-based approach to identify host
   associations of root hemiparasites growing naturally. Host associations
   of Melampyrum nemorosum, Rhinanthus major and Rhinanthus minor were
   investigated. Their root systems were washed free of soil to reveal
   haustorial connections. Host-root fragments were subjected to DNA
   extraction and the plastid DNA trnL intron was sequenced. The
   functioning of haustoria was examined in semi-thin anatomical sections.
   The analysis of the DNA of host roots yielded a ca 60\% success rate.
   The Rhinanthus species were confirmed to attack mostly grasses and

Abstract = {{The green turtle, Chelonia mydas has worldwide distribution. In Brazil,
   it is found on the coast, but spawning occurs on oceanic islands. The
   helminth fauna of green turtles is diverse and has the greatest
   diversity when compared with other species of turtles. This study aims
   to evaluate ecological aspects of gastrointestinal helminth community
   and connect to the body condition of green turtles collected on the
   coast of Espirito Santo. A total of 36 juvenile specimens of the species
   C. mydas were used. The gastrointestinal tract was removed and divided
   into portions: esophagus/stomach, small intestine and large intestine.
   Each portion was inspected looking for parasites and the specimens found
   were separated for later identification. Of the 36 turtles evaluated, 34
   were parasitized by helminths (94.44\%), with a total of 10,734
   helminths. Results include findings of 18 species of trematodes
   belonging to four families. The species richness was 4,29 +/- 2,19
   (1-10) and the mean intensity of infection was 315,64 +/- 281,83 (2-994)
   helminths. The prevalent parasites were Cricocephalus albus,
   Metacetabulum invaginatum and Neoctangium travassosi, both with 61,11\%
   (22/36), Pronocephalus obliquus with 33,33\% (12/36), and Glyphicephalus
   lobatus with 30,55\% (11/36). The abundant helminth was Metacetabulum
   invaginatum with helminths 70,63/animal, followed by C. albus with
   helminths 58,77/animal and N. travassosi with helminths 41,75/animal.}},

Abstract = {{During the cold war, Frank Fenner (protege of Macfarlane Burnet and Rene

   Fenner developed an ecological orientation in World War II through his
   work on malaria control (with Ratcliffe and Ian Mackerras, among
   others)-that is, through studies of tropical medicine. This makes Fenner
   at least a partial exception to other senior disease ecologists in the
   region, most of whom learned their ecology from examining responses to
   agricultural challenges and animal husbandry problems in settler

Abstract = {{The parasite communities of three gudgeon species (Gobio gobio,
   Romanogobio belingi and R. vladykovi) were studied in two
   widely-separated rivers in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), the
   Bilina River (North Sea drainage) and Velicka River (Black Sea
   drainage). Of the 25 parasite taxa identified, 21 species parasitised G.
   gobio, 8 species R. belingi and 13 species R. vladykovi. Due to the
   absence of specialist parasites, differences in the parasite community
   were mainly determined by the ecological conditions prevalent at the
   locality, which resulted in an increased similarity between sympatric
   species rather than between allopatric populations of the same species,
   i.e. G. gobio. Discriminant analysis showed significant differences
   between the four gudgeon populations. Five parasite species had
   significant power to discriminate particular parasite communities: the
   autogenic ectoparasites Gyrodactylus gobiensis, G. markakulensis and
   Paradiplozoon homoion; the allogenic endoparasite Metorchis xanthosomus
   and the autogenic endoparasite Acanthocephalus anguillae. Only G.
   markakulensis occurred in both allopatric populations of G. gobio.
   Sympatric gudgeon populations were discriminated mainly by the presence
   of autogenic parasites, especially those with direct life cycles.
   Differences in parasite infection level between G. gobio and
   representatives of Romanogobio may reflect variance in diet and/or
   habitat use. Allopatric populations differed in the number of allogenic
   parasite species, which were more frequent in the Velicka. Finally, the
   parasite community of R. belingi from the upper Elbe basin was
   characterised by a lack of gudgeon specific parasites, possibly
   supporting its non-indigenous status.}},

   Clinical samples from Guangzhou, China, were examined using this PCR

Abstract = {{Plants play an important role in the interactions between insect
   herbivores and their pathogens. Since the seminal review by Cory and
   Hoover (2006) on plant-mediated effects on insect-pathogen interactions,
   considerable progress has been made in understanding the complexity of
   these tritrophic interactions. Increasing interest in the areas of
   nutritional and ecological immunology over the last decade have revealed
   that plant primary and secondary metabolites can influence the outcomes
   of insect-pathogen interactions by altering insect immune functioning
   and physical barriers to pathogen entry. Some insects use plant
   secondary chemicals and nutrients to prevent infections (prophylactic
   medication) and medicate to limit the severity of infections
   (therapeutic medication). Recent findings suggest that there may be
   selectable plant traits that enhance entomopathogen efficacy, suggesting
   that entomopathogens could potentially impose selection pressure on
   plant traits that improve both pathogen and plant fitness. Moreover,
   plants in nature are inhabited by diverse communities of microbes, in
   addition to entomopathogens, some of which can trigger immune responses
   in insect herbivores. Plants are also shared by numerous other
   herbivorous arthropods with different modes of feeding that can trigger
   different defensive responses in plants. Some insect symbionts and gut
   microbes can degrade ingested defensive phytochemicals and be orally
   secreted onto wounded plant tissue during herbivory to alter plant
   defenses. Since non-entomopathogenic microbes and other arthropods are
   likely to influence the outcomes of plant-insect-entomopathogen
   interactions, I discuss a need to consider these multitrophic
   interactions within the greater web of species interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Yeasts of the now unused asexually typified genus Pseudozyma belong to
   the smut fungi (Ustilaginales) and are mostly believed to be apathogenic
   asexual yeasts derived from smut fungi that have lost pathogenicity on
   plants. However, phylogenetic studies have shown that most Pseudozyma
   species are phylogenetically close to smut fungi parasitic to plants,
   suggesting that some of the species might represent adventitious
   isolations of the yeast morph of otherwise plant pathogenic smut fungi.
   However, there are some species, such as Moesziomyces aphidis (syn.
   Pseudozyma aphidis) that are isolated throughout the world and sometimes
   are also found in clinical samples and do not have a known plant
   pathogenic sexual morph. In this study, it is revealed by phylogenetic
   investigations that isolates of the biocontrol agent Moesziomyces
   aphidis are interspersed with M. bullatus sexual lineages, suggesting
   conspecificity. This raises doubts regarding the apathogenic nature of
   asexual morphs previously placed in Pseudozyma, but suggests that there
   might also be pathogenic sexual morph counterparts for those species
   known only from asexual morphs. The finding that several additional
   species currently only known from their yeast morphs are embedded within
   the genus Moesziomyces, suggests that the yeast morph might play a more
   dominant role in this genus as compared to other genera of
   Ustilaginaceae. In addition, phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated

   were performed on two secondary olive pest honeydews and eight common
   flowering plant species in order to analyze their suitability as
   potential food sources for E. flabellatus females. Abdomen and gut
   dissections were carried out to verify the pollen consumption and the
   egg production. Floral architecture and insect morphology were
   described. Cox's proportional hazard regression models were used to
   analyze the differences between parasitoid survivals. Honeydews secreted

   clear-cutting and thinning operations. The life cycle of the fungus
   modeled combines asexual and sexual reproduction modes, and also

Abstract = {{The construction of dams in sub-Saharan Africa is pivotal for food
   security and alleviating poverty in the region. However, the unintended
   adverse public health implications of extending the spatial distribution
   of water infrastructure are poorly documented and may minimize the
   intended benefits of securing water supplies. This paper reviews
   existing studies on the influence of dams on the spatial distribution of
   malaria parasites and vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. Common themes
   emerging from the literature were that dams intensified malaria
   transmission in semi-arid and highland areas with unstable malaria
   transmission but had little or no impact in areas with perennial
   transmission. Differences in the impacts of dams resulted from the types
   and characteristics of malaria vectors and their breeding habitats in
   different settings of sub-Saharan Africa. A higher abundance of a less
   anthropophilic Anopheles arabiensis than a highly efficient vector A.
   gambiae explains why dams did not increase malaria in stable areas. In
   unstable areas where transmission is limited by availability of water
   bodies for vector breeding, dams generally increase malaria by providing
   breeding habitats for prominent malaria vector species. Integrated
   vector control measures that include reservoir management, coupled with
   conventional malaria control strategies, could optimize a reduction of
   the risk of malaria transmission around dams in the region.}},

   have shown that localities and patches within these localities are well

   estimates and relative stability. Compared to other areas in Europe,
   butterflies in Serbia start to fly 2 weeks later in the summer, probably
   a consequence of a late mowing regime initiated during July. Some
   evidence of a negative relationship between the survival of P. teleius

   considerable economic losses to the breeding industry. This is the first
   mt genome of a caryophyllidean cestode characterised. The entire mt
   genome of K. sinensis is 13,759 bp in length. This mt genome contains 12
   protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and
   two non-coding regions. The arrangement of the K. sinensis mt genome is
   the same as other tapeworms, however, the incomplete stop codon (A) is
   more frequent that other species. Phylogenetic analyses based on
   concatenated amino-acid sequences of the 12 protein-coding genes of 17
   tapeworms including K. sinensis were conducted to assess the
   relationship of K. sinensis with other species, the result indicated K.
   sinensis was closely related with cestode species. This complete mt
   genome of K. sinensis will enrich the mitochondrial genome databases of
   tapeworms and provide important molecular markers for ecology,
   diagnostics, population variation and evolution of K. sinensis and other

Abstract = {{The thermal sensitivities of organisms regulate a wide range of
   ecological interactions, including host-parasite dynamics. The effect of
   temperature on disease ecology can be remarkably complex in disease
   systems where the hosts are ectothermic and where thermal conditions
   constrain pathogen reproductive rates. Amphibian chytridiomycosis,
   caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a lethal
   fungal disease that is influenced by temperature. However, recent
   temperature studies have produced contradictory findings, suggesting
   that our current understanding of thermal effects on Bd may be
   incomplete. We investigated how temperature affects three different Bd
   strains to evaluate diversity in thermal responses. We quantified growth
   across the entire thermal range of Bd, and beyond the known thermal
   limits (T-max and T-min). Our results show that all Bd strains remained
   viable and grew following 24 h freeze (-12 degrees C) and heat shock (28
   degrees C) treatments. Additionally, we found that two Bd strains had
   higher logistic growth rates (r) and carrying capacities (K) at the
   upper and lower extremities of the temperature range, and especially in
   low temperature conditions (2-3 degrees C). In contrast, a third strain
   exhibited relatively lower growth rates and carrying capacities at these
   same thermal extremes. Overall, our results suggest that there is
   considerable variation among Bd strains in thermal tolerance, and they
   establish a new thermal sensitivity profile for Bd. More generally, our
   findings point toward important questions concerning the mechanisms that
   dictate fungal thermal tolerances and temperature-dependent pathogenesis
   in other fungal disease systems.}},

Abstract = {{Oceanic islands share several environmental characteristics that have
   been shown to drive convergent evolutionary changes in island organisms.
   One change that is often assumed but has seldom been examined is the
   evolution of weaker immune systems in island species. The reduction in
   species richness on islands is expected to lead to a reduced parasite
   pressure and, given that immune function is costly, island animals
   should show a reduced immune response. However, alternative hypotheses
   exist; for example, the slower pace of life on islands could favor the
   reorganization of the immune system components (innate vs. acquired
   immunity) on islands. Thus far, few island species have been studied and
   no general patterns have emerged. Here, we compared two immune
   parameters of birds from SAo Tome and Principe islands to those of their
   close relatives at similar latitudes on the mainland (Gabon, West
   Africa). On islands, the acquired humoral component (total
   immunoglobulins) was lower for most species, whereas no clear pattern
   was detected for the innate component (haptoglobin levels). These
   different responses did not seem to arise from a reorganization of the
   two immune components, as both total immunoglobulins and haptoglobin
   levels were positively associated. This work adds to the few empirical
   studies conducted so far which suggest that changes in immune parameters
   in response to insularity are not as straightforward as initially
   thought.}},

Abstract = {{Parasite diversity and abundance (parasite load) vary greatly among host
   species. However, the influence of host traits on variation in
   parasitism remains poorly understood. Comparative studies of parasite
   load have largely examined measures of parasite species richness and are
   predominantly based on records obtained from published data.
   Consequently, little is known about the relationships between host
   traits and other aspects of parasite load, such as parasite abundance,
   prevalence and aggregation. Meanwhile, understanding of parasite species
   richness may be clouded by limitations associated with data collation
   from multiple independent sources. We conducted a field study of Lake
   Tanganyika cichlid fishes and their helminth parasites. Using a Bayesian
   phylogenetic comparative framework, we tested evolutionary associations
   between five key host traits (body size, gut length, diet breadth,
   habitat complexity and number of sympatric hosts) predicted to influence
   parasitism, together with multiple measures of parasite load. We find
   that the number of host species that a particular host may encounter due
   to its habitat preferences emerges as a factor of general importance for
   parasite diversity, abundance and prevalence, but not parasite
   aggregation. In contrast, body size and gut size are positively related
   to aspects of parasite load within, but not between species. The
   influence of host phylogeny varies considerably among measures of
   parasite load, with the greatest influence exerted on parasite
   diversity. These results reveal that both host morphology and biotic
   interactions are key determinants of host-parasite associations and that
   consideration of multiple aspects of parasite load is required to fully
   understand patterns in parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites rely on resources from a host and are selected to achieve an
   optimal combination of transmission and virulence. Human-induced changes
   in parasite ecology, such as intensive farming of hosts, might not only
   favour increased parasite abundances, but also alter the selection
   acting on parasites and lead to life-history evolution. The trade-off
   between transmission and virulence could be affected by intensive
   farming practices such as high host density and the use of antiparasitic
   drugs, which might lead to increased virulence in some host-parasite
   systems. To test this, we therefore infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) smolts with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) sampled either
   from wild or farmed hosts in a laboratory experiment. We compared growth
   and skin damage (i.e. proxies for virulence) of hosts infected with
   either wild or farmed lice and found that, compared to lice sampled from
   wild hosts in unfarmed areas, those originating from farmed fish were
   more harmful; they inflicted more skin damage to their hosts and reduced
   relative host weight gain to a greater extent. We advocate that more

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Within complex ecological systems, identifying animal species likely
   to play a key role in the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases
   remains a major challenge. One approach consists of using information on
   current ecological and parasitological similarities among host species
   in order to predict the most likely pathways for future pathogen
   spillover.
   2. Using field data acquired from 15 sympatric rodent species in various
   habitats in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, we built networks based on
   shared parasites (17 helminth and 15 microparasite species) and shared
   habitats among rodent species and humans. We investigated the
   architectures of bipartite and unipartite networks using modularity,
   subgroups partitioning or node centrality, to assess the relative
   epidemiological importance of particular rodent species.
   3. Our results showed that Rattus tanezumi, Bandicota savilei and R.
   exulans were consistently found to be members of subgroups that included
   humans in unipartite and bipartite networks on zoonotic agents and
   shared habitats. High values of centrality in shared zoonotic agents
   were found for the same three rodent species, whereas high values of
   shared habitats were observed for two of them. Although phylogenetically
   related rodent species likely shared both habitats and parasites, a lack
   of habitat specialization was associated with increased zoonotic
   parasite sharing.
   4. Our results emphasize the disproportionate importance of these three
   rodent species, through their high degree of connectivity with humans,
   which may represent a high risk for direct zoonotic spillover. Moreover,
   due to its high centrality in habitats, R. tanezumi may also play a key
   role as a bridge host.
   5. The recent discovery of new arenaviruses in rodents in South-East
   Asia, with associated disease in humans in Cambodia, provides an
   opportunity to test this empirically. The three rodent species
   identified using our network approach are some of the potential
   maintenance hosts for these new emerging arenaviruses.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results on rodents and their
   pathogens in South-East Asia show that network analysis has a high
   potential to improve the surveillance of emerging zoonotic pathogens by
   targeting key host species and potential `emerging' pathogen-rodent
   interactions in complex and heterogeneous landscapes.}},

   The species is considered a secondary vector in the transmission of

Abstract = {{Perkinsosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites from the

   rhizophorae) from cultured and wild populations in several states of the
   Northeast region. The impacts of this disease in bivalves from Brazil,
   as well as the interactions with environmental factors, are poorly
   studied. In the present work, we evaluated the in vitro effects of the
   cyanobacteria Synechocystis spp. on trophozoites of P. marinas and
   haemocytes of C. gasar. Four cyanobacteria strains isolated from the
   Northeast Brazilian coast were used as whole cultures (WCs) and
   extracellular products (ECPs). Trophozoites of P. marinus were exposed
   for short (4 h) and long (48 h and 7 days, the latter only for ECPs)
   periods, while haemocytes were exposed for a short period (4 h).
   Cellular and immune parameters, i.e. cell viability, cell count,
   reactive oxygen species production (ROS) and phagocytosis of inert
   (latex beads) and biological particles (zymosan and trophozoites of P.
   marinus) were measured by flow cytometry. The viability of P. marinas
   trophozoites was improved in response to WCs of Synechocystis spp.,
   which could be a beneficial effect of the cyanobacteria providing
   nutrients and reducing reactive oxygen species. Long-term exposure of
   trophozoites to ECPs of cyanobacteria did not modify in vitro cell
   proliferation nor viability. in contrast, C. gasar haemocytes showed a
   reduction in cell viability when exposed to WCs, but not to ECPs.
   However, ROS production was not altered. Haemocyte ability to engulf
   latex particles was reduced when exposed mainly to ECPs of
   cyanobacteria; while neither the WCs nor the ECPs modified phagocytosis
   of the biological particles, zymosan and P. marinas. Our results suggest
   a negative effect of cyanobacteria from the Synechocystis genus on host
   immune cells, in contrast to a more beneficial effect on the parasite
   cell, which could together disrupt the balance of the host-parasite
   interaction and make oysters more susceptible to P. marinas as well as
   opportunistic infections.}},

Abstract = {{Trans-generational plasticity (TGP) is the adjustment of phenotypes to
   changing habitat conditions that persist longer than the individual
   lifetime. Fitness benefits (adaptive TGP) are expected upon matching
   parent-offspring environments. In a global change scenario, several
   performance-related environmental factors are changing simultaneously.
   This lowers the predictability of offspring environmental conditions,
   potentially hampering the benefits of TGP. For the first time, we here
   explore how the combination of an abiotic and a biotic environmental
   factor in the parental generation plays out as trans-generational effect
   in the offspring. We fully reciprocally exposed the parental generation
   of the pipefish Syngnathus typhle to an immune challenge and elevated
   temperatures simulating a naturally occurring heatwave. Upon mating and
   male pregnancy, offspring were kept in ambient or elevated temperature
   regimes combined with a heat-killed bacterial epitope treatment.
   Differential gene expression (immune genes and DNA- and
   histone-modification genes) suggests that the combined change of an
   abiotic and a biotic factor in the parental generation had interactive
   effects on offspring performance, the temperature effect dominated over
   the immune challenge impact. The benefits of certain parental
   environmental conditions on offspring performance did not sum up when
   abiotic and biotic factors were changed simultaneously supporting that
   available resources that can be allocated to phenotypic
   trans-generational effects are limited. Temperature is the master
   regulator of trans-generational phenotypic plasticity, which potentially
   implies a conflict in the allocation of resources towards several
   environmental factors. This asks for a reassessment of TGP as a

   Pine Barrens seasonally for 1 y to measure the biomass density of all
   major consumer groups, including macroparasites infecting fish and
   macroinvertebrates. Parasites made up a small percentage of consumer
   biomass in Pine Barrens streams, representing just 0.00643 to 0.00733\%
   of total consumer biomass annually. These low values contrast with
   higher estimates from other aquatic ecosystems, where parasite biomass
   exceeds that of some free-living consumers. The mean biomass densities
   of all consumer groups differed significantly between the 2 streams,
   perhaps because of stream characteristics, such as productivity or pH.
   Comparison of parasite biomass density in these 2 streams with that in 3
   other types of aquatic ecosystems reveals substantial variation both

   Cuitzeo basin, Michoacan state, Mexico, and measured herbivory levels
   and foliar water content, total nonstructural carbohydrates, phenols,
   flavonoids, and hydrolyzable tannins in each sample. Higher levels of
   infection by P. calyculatus were found in the smaller forest fragments,
   while foliar damage by herbivores was higher in larger forest fragments.
   At all sites, levels of herbivory were lower in the mistletoe than in
   both parasitized and unparasitized oaks. However, there was a positive
   relationship between herbivory levels in parasitized oaks and their
   mistletoes. Also, foliar water content and total phenol concentration
   were positively correlated between the oaks and the mistletoes. The
   results suggest that herbivory levels in parasitized hosts and
   mistletoes depend on the close physiological interaction between the
   nutritional quality and the chemical defense of the two plants involved.
   This is one of the few studies analyzing the chemical ecology of the
   interaction between plant hosts and plant parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Several phases of herbivorous insect attack including feeding and

   theory has been specifically proposed in relation to the major surface
   antigen of the blood stage, known as PfEMP1 and encoded by the multicopy
   multigene family known as the var genes. Deep sampling of the DBLa
   domain of var genes in the local population of Bakoumba, West Africa,

   role of immune selection under the opposing force of high outcrossing, a
   characteristic of areas of intense malaria transmission. Using a 454
   high-throughput sequencing protocol, we report extremely high diversity

Abstract = {{The blue crab Callinectes sapidus has seen a general decline in

   conducted in 2014 and 2015 to monitor H. perezi DNA within the Maryland
   (USA) coastal bays, comparing seasonal cycles in the abundance of
   parasite DNA in environmental samples to parasite presence in host blue
   crabs. A late summer to early fall peak in H. perezi infections in blue
   crabs was observed, consistent with previous work. Infection intensities
   matched this trend, showing a slow progression of low intensity
   infections early in the year, with a peak in moderate and heavy
   infections occurring between July and September, for both years. It was
   hypo thesized that the peak in water column occurrence would coincide
   with those months when infection intensities were highest in blue crabs.
   As the peaks in water column occurrence were in July 2014 and
   August-September 2015, this is consistent with sporulation being the
   primary contributor to environmental detection in summer months. An
   additional peak in environmental detection occurred in both years during
   the early spring months, the cause of which is currently unknown but may

Abstract = {{This article overviews the dynamics of disease transmission in
   one-host-one-parasite systems. Transmission is the result of interacting
   host and pathogen processes, encapsulated with the environment in a

   epidemiological consequences are often not understood because the direct
   measurement of transmission is difficult. However, its different
   components can be analysed using nonlinear transmission functions,
   contact matrices and networks. A particular challenge is to develop such
   functions for spatially extended systems. This is illustrated for vector
   transmission where a `perception kernel' approach is developed that
   incorporates vector behaviour in response to host spacing. A major
   challenge is understanding the relative merits of the large number of
   approaches to quantifying transmission. The evolution of transmission
   mode itself has been a rather neglected topic, but is important in the
   context of understanding disease emergence and genetic variation in
   pathogens. Disease impacts many biological processes such as community
   stability, the evolution of sex and speciation, yet the importance of
   different transmission modes in these processes is not understood.
   Broader approaches and ideas to disease transmission are important in

Abstract = {{Human factors, including contact structure, movement, impact on the

   alters natural systems and global economic forces drive land-use and
   land-cover change, it becomes increasingly important to understand both
   the ecological and social factors that impact infectious disease
   outcomes for human populations. While the field of disease ecology
   explicitly studies the ecological aspects of infectious disease
   transmission, the effects of the social context on zoonotic pathogen
   spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission are comparatively
   neglected in the literature. The social sciences encompass a variety of
   disciplines and frameworks for understanding infectious diseases;
   however, here we focus on four primary areas of social systems that
   quantitatively and qualitatively contribute to infectious diseases as
   social-ecological systems. These areas are social mixing and structure,
   space and mobility, geography and environmental impact, and behaviour
   and behaviour change. Incorporation of these social factors requires
   empirical studies for parametrization, phenomena characterization and
   integrated theoretical modelling of social-ecological interactions. The
   social-ecological system that dictates infectious disease dynamics is a
   complex system rich in interacting variables with dynamically

   co-occurring parasites: the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the fungus
   Metschnikowia bicuspidata. Both parasites were capable of transmission
   from the reservoir host (Daphnia dentifera) to the spillover host
   (Ceriodaphnia dubia), but this occurred at a much higher rate for the

   combining information on parasite transmission and growth rate, and used
   this to compare parasite fitness in the two host species. For both
   parasites, transmission potential was lower in the spillover host. For
   the bacterium, virulence was higher in the spillover host. Transmission
   back to the original host was high for both parasites, with spillover

Abstract = {{An overlooked aspect of disease ecology is considering how and why
   animals come into contact with one and other resulting in disease
   transmission. Mathematical models of disease spread frequently assume
   mass-action transmission, justified by stating that susceptible and
   infectious hosts mix readily, and foregoing any detailed description of
   host movement. Numerous recent studies have recorded, analysed and
   modelled animal movement. These movement models describe how animals
   move with respect to resources, conspecifics and previous movement
   directions and have been used to understand the conditions for the
   occurrence and the spread of infectious diseases when hosts perform a
   type of movement. Here, we summarize the effect of the different types
   of movement on the threshold conditions for disease spread. We identify
   gaps in the literature and suggest several promising directions for
   future research. The mechanistic inclusion of movement in epidemic
   models may be beneficial for the following two reasons. Firstly, the
   estimation of the transmission coefficient in an epidemic model is
   possible because animal movement data can be used to estimate the rate
   of contacts between conspecifics. Secondly, unsuccessful transmission
   events, where a susceptible host contacts an infectious host but does
   not become infected can be quantified. Following an outbreak, this
   enables disease ecologists to identify `near misses' and to explore
   possible alternative epidemic outcomes given shifts in ecological or

Abstract = {{Parasite species often show differential fitness on different host
   species. We developed an equation-based model to explore conditions
   favouring host species exploitation and discrimination. In ourmodel,
   diploid infective stages randomly encountered hosts of two species; the
   parasite's relative fitness in exploiting each host species, and its
   ability to discriminate between them, was determined by the parasite's
   genotype at two independent diallelic loci. Relative host species
   frequency determined allele frequencies at the exploitation locus,
   whereas differential fitness and combined host density determined
   frequency of discrimination alleles. The model predicts instances where
   populations contain mixes of discriminatory and non-discriminatory
   infective stages. Also, non-discriminatory parasites should evolve when
   differential fitness is low to moderate and when combined host densities
   are low, but not so lowas to cause parasite extinction. A corollary is
   that parasite discrimination (and host-specificity) increases with
   higher combined host densities. Instances in nature where parasites fail
   to discriminate when differential fitness is extreme could be explained
   by one host species evolving resistance, following from earlier
   selection for parasite non-discrimination. Similar results overall were
   obtained for haploid extensions of the model. Our model emulates
   multi-host associations and has implications for understanding
   broadening of host species ranges by parasites.

Abstract = {{The harm that pathogens cause to hosts during infection, termed

   predicts that higher within-host growth causes increased transmission
   and higher virulence. However, using data from 61 human pathogens, we
   found the opposite correlation to the expected positive correlation
   between pathogen growth rate and virulence. We found that (i) slower
   growing pathogens are significantly more virulent than faster growing
   pathogens, (ii) inhaled pathogens and pathogens that infect via skin
   wounds are significantly more virulent than pathogens that are ingested,
   but (ii) there is no correlation between symptoms of infection that aid

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly clear that the evolution of infectious
   disease is influenced by host population structure. Theory predicts that
   parasites should be more `prudent'-less transmissible-in spatially
   structured host populations. However, here we (i) highlight how low
   transmission, the phenotype being selected for in this in context, may
   also be achieved by rapacious host exploitation, if fast host
   exploitation confers a local, within-host competitive advantage and (ii)
   test this novel concept in a bacteria-virus system. We found that
   limited host availability and, to a lesser extent, low relatedness
   favour faster-killing parasites with reduced transmission. By contrast,
   high host availability and high relatedness favour slower-killing, more
   transmissible parasites. Our results suggest high, rather than low,
   virulence may be selected in spatially structured host-parasite
   communities where local competition and hence selection for a
   within-host fitness advantage is high.

Abstract = {{Transmission is a fundamental step in the life cycle of every parasite
   but it is also one of the most challenging processes to model and
   quantify. In most host-parasite models, the transmission process is
   encapsulated by a single parameter b. Many different biological
   processes and interactions, acting on both hosts and infectious
   organisms, are subsumed in this single term. There are, however, at
   least two undesirable consequences of this high level of abstraction.
   First, nonlinearities and heterogeneities that can be critical to the
   dynamic behaviour of infections are poorly represented; second,
   estimating the transmission coefficient b from field data is often very
   difficult. In this paper, we present a conceptual model, which breaks
   the transmission process into its component parts. This deconstruction
   enables us to identify circumstances that generate nonlinearities in
   transmission, with potential implications for emergent transmission
   behaviour at individual and population scales. Such behaviour cannot be
   explained by the traditional linear transmission frameworks. The
   deconstruction also provides a clearer link to the empirical estimation
   of key components of transmission and enables the construction of
   flexible models that produce a unified understanding of the spread of
   both micro-and macro-parasite infectious disease agents.

Abstract = {{Infectious disease dynamics depend on the speed, number and fitness of
   parasites transmitting from infected hosts ('donors') to parasite-naive
   `recipients'. Donor heterogeneity likely affects these three parameters,
   and may arise from variation between donors in traits including: (i)
   infection load, (ii) resistance, (iii) stage of infection, and (iv)
   previous experience of transmission. We used the Trinidadian guppy,
   Poecilia reticulata, and a directly transmitted monogenean ectoparasite,
   Gyrodactylus turnbulli, to experimentally explore how these sources of
   donor heterogeneity affect the three transmission parameters. We exposed
   parasite-naive recipients to donors (infected with a single parasite
   strain) differing in their infection traits, and found that donor
   infection traits had diverse and sometimes interactive effects on
   transmission. First, although transmission speed increased with donor
   infection load, the relationship was nonlinear. Second, while the number
   of parasites transmitted generally increased with donor infection load,
   more resistant donors transmitted more parasites, as did those with
   previous transmission experience. Finally, parasites transmitting from
   experienced donors exhibited lower population growth rates on recipients
   than those from inexperienced donors. Stage of infection had little
   effect on transmission parameters. These results suggest that a more
   holistic consideration of within-host processes will improve our
   understanding of between-host transmission and hence disease dynamics.

Abstract = {{Parasites vary widely in the diversity of hosts they infect: some
   parasite species are specialists-infecting just a single host species,
   while others are generalists, capable of infecting many. Understanding
   the factors that drive parasite host-generalism is of basic biological
   interest, but also directly relevant to predicting disease emergence in
   new host species, identifying parasites that are likely to have
   unidentified additional hosts, and assessing transmission risk. Here, we
   use mathematical models to investigate how variation in host body size
   and environmental temperature affect the evolution of parasite
   host-generalism. We predict that parasites are more likely to evolve a
   generalist strategy when hosts are large-bodied, when variation in host
   body size is large, and in cooler environments. We then explore these
   predictions using a newly updated database of over 20 000
   fish-macroparasite associations. Within the database we see some
   evidence supporting these predictions, but also highlight mismatches
   between theory and data. By combining these two approaches, we establish
   a theoretical basis for interpreting empirical data on parasites' host
   specificity and identify key areas for future work that will help
   untangle the drivers of parasite host-generalism.

Abstract = {{For many parasites, the full set of hosts that are susceptible to
   infection is not known, and this could lead to a bias in estimates of
   transmission. We used counts of individual adult parasites from
   historical parasitology studies in southern Africa to map a bipartite
   network of the nematode parasites of herbivore hosts that occur in
   Botswana. Bipartite networks are used in community ecology to represent
   interactions across trophic levels. We used a Bayesian hierarchical
   model to predict the full set of host-parasite interactions from
   existing data on parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes of wild and
   domestic ungulates given assumptions about the distribution of parasite
   counts within hosts, while accounting for the relative uncertainty of
   less sampled species. We used network metrics to assess the difference
   between the observed and predicted networks, and to explore the
   connections between hosts via their shared parasites using a host-host
   unipartite network projected from the bipartite network. The model
   predicts a large number of missing links and identifies red hartebeest,
   giraffe and steenbok as the hosts that have the most uncertainty in
   parasite diversity. Further, the unipartite network reveals clusters of
   herbivores that have a high degree of parasite sharing, and these
   clusters correspond closely with phylogenetic distance rather than with
   the wild/domestic boundary. These results provide a basis for predicting
   the risk of cross-species transmission of nematode parasites in areas

Abstract = {{Biological invasions have movement at the core of their success.
   However, due to difficulties in collecting data, medium- and
   long-distance dispersal of small insects has long been poorly understood
   and likely to be underestimated. The agricultural release of parasitic
   hymenoptera, a group of wasps that are critical for biological pest
   control, represents a rare opportunity to study the spread of insects on
   multiple spatial scales. As these insects are typically less than 1 mm
   in size and are challenging to track individually, a first-time
   biocontrol release will provide a known spatial position and time of
   initial release for all individuals that are subsequently collected. In
   this paper, we develop and validate a new mathematical model for
   parasitoid wasp dispersal from point release, as in the case of
   biocontrol. The model is derived from underlying stochastic processes
   but is fully deterministic and admits an analytical solution. Using a
   Bayesian framework, we then fit the model to an Australian dataset
   describing the multi-scale wind-borne dispersal pattern of Eretmocerus
   hayati Zolnerowich \& Rose (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). Our results
   confirm that both local movements and long-distance wind dispersal are
   significant to the movement of parasitoids. The model results also
   suggest that low velocity winds are the primary indicator of dispersal
   direction on the field scale shortly after release, and that average
   wind data may be insufficient to resolve long-distance movement given
   inherent nonlinearities and heterogeneities in atmospheric flows. The
   results highlight the importance of collecting wind data when developing

   developed specifically for the project to genotype 241 individuals from
   six populations (four ``island{''} and two ``mainland{''} locations) at
   the western edge of the Central Rocky Mountains, Idaho, USA. All loci
   were unlinked and polymorphic with a range of 4-24 alleles per locus. To
   consider gene flow, we performed spatial analyses and compared
   F-statistics from our data to those from a wide range of species and
   functional groups. We tested the predictions of biogeographic theory by
   quantifying associations of genetic diversity with ``island{''} area and
   isolation from ``mainland{''} populations. To consider the genetic
   relationships of ``island{''} and ``mainland{''} regions, we applied
   agglomerative and Bayesian hierarchical classifications to datasets, and
   objectively identified the optimal numbers of clusters in these
   analyses. We found that F-IS values in A. americanum were similar to
   those reported for dispersal-limited species with similar life-history
   characteristics, and F-ST values were similar to those reported for
   plants with animal-facilitated seed dispersal. As predicted by
   biogeographic theory, island allelic richness was positively correlated
   with geographic size of the population and negatively correlated with
   distance from mainland populations. Average linkage (UPGMA)
   classifications and Bayesian cluster analyses both identified two
   groupings of island populations radiating from the mainland populations.

Abstract = {{1. A key rationale for pursuing de-extinction is the potential to
   restore lost processes and function to modern ecosystems. However,
   understanding and providing for the ecological requirements of the
   candidate species will also play a key role in determining the ultimate
   success of a de-extinction. This assessment is challenging for
   prehistoric extinct species, where empirical studies or observations on
   their ecology are not available or are incomplete.
   2. A healthy, stable and self-sustaining population of a resurrected
   species needs to be embedded in an ecological interaction network that
   consists not only of interactions between a resurrected species and its
   external environment (e.g. habitat, diet), but also those where the
   resurrected species is the environment (e.g. microbiota and parasites).
   Palaeoecology can provide information on all of these interactions for
   extinct species, and this information can help guide and inform the
   selection of suitable de-extinction candidates or traits for
   resurrection.
   3. Ecological interaction network analyses offer a complementary tool to
   existing frameworks for determining the suitability of de-extinction
   candidates, allowing palaeoecological information to be used to identify
   and quantify the potential implications of removing or adding
   resurrected species/functions to an ecosystem.
   4. Although palaeoecological data and understanding clearly have an
   important role in informing and modelling the potential ecological
   functions provided by extinct species, they can only ever provide an
   incomplete picture and therefore would only complement, rather than
   replace, observational or experimental data on the resurrected organisms

   of natural ecological parameters are thus of key importance for our
   understanding of an organism's biology. Curiously, the natural ecology
   of the model species Caenorhabditis elegans has long been neglected,
   even though this nematode has become one of the most intensively studied
   models in biological research. This lack of interest changed similar to
   10 yr ago. Since then, an increasing number of studies have focused on
   the nematode's natural ecology. Yet many unknowns still remain. Here, we
   provide an overview of the currently available information on the
   natural environment of C. elegans. We focus on the biotic environment,
   which is usually less predictable and thus can create high selective
   constraints that are likely to have had a strong impact on C. elegans
   evolution. This nematode is particularly abundant in microbe-rich
   environments, especially rotting plant matter such as decomposing fruits
   and stems. In this environment, it is part of a complex interaction
   network, which is particularly shaped by a species-rich microbial
   community. These microbes can be food, part of a beneficial gut
   microbiome, parasites and pathogens, and possibly competitors. C.
   elegans is additionally confronted with predators; it interacts with
   vector organisms that facilitate dispersal to new habitats, and also
   with competitors for similar food environments, including competitors
   from congeneric and also the same species. Full appreciation of this
   nematode's biology warrants further exploration of its natural
   environment and subsequent integration of this information into the
   well-established laboratory-based research approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Primate habitats are being transformed by human activities such as
   agriculture. Many wild primates include cultivated foods (crops) in
   their diets, calling for an improved understanding of the costs and
   benefits of crop feeding. We measured the macronutrient and antifeedant
   content of 44 wild and 21 crop foods eaten by chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes schweinfurthii) in a mosaic habitat at Bulindi, Uganda, to
   evaluate the common assertion that crops offer high nutritional returns
   compared to wild forage for primates. In addition, we analyzed 13 crops
   not eaten at Bulindi but that are consumed by chimpanzees elsewhere to
   assess whether nutritional aspects explain why chimpanzees in Bulindi
   ignored them. Our analysis of their wild plant diet (fruit, leaves, and
   pith) corresponds with previous chemical analyses of primate plant
   foods. Compared to wild food equivalents, crops eaten by the chimpanzees
   contained higher levels of digestible carbohydrates (mainly sugars)
   coupled with lower amounts of insoluble fiber and antifeedants.
   Cultivated fruits were relatively nutritious throughout the ripening
   process. Our data support the assumption that eating cultivated foods
   confers energetic advantages for primates, although crops in our sample
   were low in protein and lipids compared to some wild foods. We found
   little evidence that crops ignored by the chimpanzees were less
   nutritious than those that they did eat. Nonnutritional factors, e.g.,
   similarity to wild foods, probably also influence crop selection.
   Whether cultivated habitats can support threatened but flexible primates
   such as chimpanzees in the long term hinges on local people's
   willingness to share their landscape and resources with them.}},

Abstract = {{Across host-parasite systems, there is evidence that pesticide exposure
   increases parasite loads and mortality following infection. However,
   whether these effects are driven by reductions in host resistance to
   infection or slower rates of parasite clearance is often unclear. Using
   controlled laboratory experiments, we examined the ability of larval
   northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and American toads (Anaxyrus
   americanus) to resist and clear trematode (Echinoparyphium sp.)
   infections following exposure to the insecticide carbaryl. Northern
   leopard frogs exposed to 1 mg L-1 of carbaryl had 61\% higher parasite
   loads compared with unexposed individuals, while there was no immediate
   effect of carbaryl on parasite encystment in American toads. However,
   when tadpoles were exposed to carbaryl and moved to freshwater for 14
   days before the parasite challenge, we recovered 37 and 63\% more
   parasites from carbaryl-exposed northern leopard frogs and American
   toads, respectively, compared with the control. No effects on clearance
   were found for either species. Collectively, our results suggest that
   pesticide exposure can reduce the ability of amphibians to resist
   parasite infections and that these effects can persist weeks following
   exposure. It is critical for researchers to incorporate species

Abstract = {{Biological control of greenhouse pests has been successfully developed

   One important aspect of these crops, which represent modified
   ecosystems, is the interactions among complexes of species, including
   plants, phytophagous insects, and predators. The chemical relationships
   (semiochemicals: pheromones and kairomones) among these species likely
   play an important role in greenhouse crops; however, few studies have
   focused on these relationships. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   importance of semiochemicals. Three groups of laboratory trials were
   conducted with two predatory species: Nabis pseudoferus and Nesidiocoris
   tenuis (Hemiptera: Nabidae and Miridae, respectively). The results of
   the first group of trials indicated that the adult females of both
   species were more attracted to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs)
   than they were to the control plants or plants with artificial damage.
   Based on the second group of trials, pheromones triggered an attraction
   in adult females of both species for conspecifics. Finally, based on the
   interactions of the adult females of the same species, pheromones
   changed or modulated the predatory responses to HIPVs. The implications

   species displacement in the opposite direction in Japan is probably due
   to the relatively high fecundity of L. sativae and differential effects

Abstract = {{Mycoheterotrophic plants obtain organic carbon from associated
   mycorrhizal fungi, fully or partially. Angiosperms with this form of
   nutrition possess exceptionally small `dust seeds' which after
   germination develop `seedlings' that remain subterranean for several
   years, fully dependent on fungi for supply of carbon. Mycoheterotrophs
   which as adults have photosynthesis thus develop from full to partial
   mycoheterotrophy, or autotrophy, during ontogeny. Mycoheterotrophic
   plants may represent a gradient of variation in a parasitism-mutualism
   continuum, both among and within species. Previous studies on
   plant-fungal associations in mycoheterotrophs have focused on either
   germination or the adult life stages of the plant. Much less is known
   about the fungal associations during development of the subterranean
   seedlings. We investigated germination and seedling development and the
   diversity of fungi associated with germinating seeds and subterranean
   seedlings (juveniles) in five Monotropoideae (Ericaceae) species, the
   full mycoheterotroph Monotropa hypopitys and the putatively partial
   mycoheterotrophs Pyrola chlorantha, P. rotundifolia, Moneses uniflora

   germination, seedling development and diversity of associated fungi
   during juvenile ontogeny. Results suggest that fungal host specificity
   increases during juvenile ontogeny, most pronounced in the fully
   mycoheterotrophic species, but a narrowing of fungal associates was

Abstract = {{Understanding how invasive plants affect biodiversity is a crucial
   conservation need. Numerous studies examine impacts of invasions on
   birds, but trends in these effects have not been synthesized. We
   reviewed 128 studies from North America to quantify the frequency of
   positive, negative, and neutral (non-significant) effects of invasive
   plants on avian ecology, and then evaluated support for proposed
   mechanisms of impacts. Our frequency-based approach enabled us to draw
   value from the full breadth of available literature, including articles
   that do not provide information necessary for meta-analyses and articles
   examining understudied phenomena. Total avian abundance and prevalence
   of individual bird species were usually unaffected by invasion, with
   48.9 and 57.2\% of tests showing neutral results, respectively. Avian
   richness decreased with invasion in 41.3\% of tests. Although birds
   often preferred nesting in invasive vegetation (45.0\% of tests),
   effects on nest survival were typically neutral (57.9\%). Multiple
   metrics (e.g. body condition, fledgling survival) have received scant
   attention. Some of the patterns we highlight differ across ecological
   contexts, emphasizing the need to understand impact mechanisms. Several
   studies have directly linked invasion impacts to altered nest-site
   availability, habitat heterogeneity, and food supplies. There is mixed
   evidence that plant architecture impacts nest-site selection and nest
   predation. Our review highlights the nonuniform consequences of
   biological invasions. The high frequency of reported neutral effects
   suggests that invasions often have minimal impacts on birds, but
   positive and negative impacts certainly can arise. Managers considering
   eradicating invasive plants for avian conservation should monitor
   impacts locally to determine whether eradication will be beneficial.}},

   diversity and seasonal migration increase parasite richness in avian
   hosts.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe compiled a global dataset on helminth species richness,
   habitat use strategies (marine/freshwater/mixed wintering and osmotic
   generalist/specialist) and various ecological/life-history traits
   (migration distance, geographical range size, diet, body mass, sampling
   latitude) of Charadriiform birds. To test if hosts with different
   habitat use strategies encounter different parasite pressures, we used
   comparative methods that correct for shared ancestry and phylogenetic
   uncertainty.
   ResultsHabitat generalists (mixed wintering habitats and osmotic
   generalists) harboured more parasite species than habitat specialists;
   marine- and freshwater-restricted hosts had similar helminth species
   richness. Contrary to previous results, we found no association between
   parasite species richness and migration distance. Overall helminth
   species richness also increased with diet diversity, with no effects of
   other ecological/life-history traits.
   Main conclusionsWe suggest that birds exploiting diverse habitats and
   diets are exposed to a more diverse parasite fauna and conclude that
   distribution patterns and habitat use, rather than migration distance,
   shape parasite diversity within host populations. Overall, these results
   demonstrate the significant role of habitat use in explaining how
   migration may indirectly affect parasite richness in host populations.}},

   In this study, DNA barcoding was used to explore the genetic variation

   presented a comprehensive approach analyzing the effectiveness of two
   gene markers, i.e. CO1 and 16S rRNA. The high threshold genetic

   substitutions were lower in CO1 if compared to 16S rRNA, which
   influenced its differentiating potential among Indian haplotypes. NJ
   tree was well supported with high branch values for CO1 gene than 16S
   rRNA, indicating ideal genetic differentiation among haplotypes. TCS
   haplotype network revealed 14 distinct clusters. The intra- and
   inter-population polymorphism were calculated among the global and
   Indian Cx. quinquefasciatus lineages. The genetic diversity index
   Tajima' D showed negative values for all the 4 intra-population clusters
   (G2-4, G10). Fu's FS showed negative value for G10 cluster, which was
   significant and indicated recent population expansion. However, the

   investigate Anisakis simplex s.l. infection in herring viscera}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{40-47}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. are anisakid nematodes with
   complex life cycles that utilise crustacean, fish and, finally, marine
   mammal hosts. Many species of marine fish are used by these larval
   anisakids as paratenic or intermediate hosts, and these are capable of
   infecting human consumers, causing public health, economic and social
   concerns worldwide. They are responsible for a fish-borne zoonosis
   called anisakidosis and associated allergic problems in humans, monetary
   loss to the fishing industry and the avoidance of fish products by
   consumers. An understanding of the parasite/fish relationship and the
   development of improved methods and tools for parasite detection are
   important to provide better insights to their biology, as well as
   technology to control the quality and safety of fishery products. In the
   present study, Anisakis simplex s.l. infection levels and location
   within the viscera of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) were visually
   investigated to provide a better understanding of settlement behaviour
   within the host fish, and to test if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
   a useful technology to detect anisakids in the viscera of whole herring.
   MRI potential to detect anisakids in fish muscle was also tested. Visual
   inspection determined an ascaridoid prevalence of 76\% (>90\% A. simplex
   s.l. (likely A. simplex s.s.) in herring viscera, with 69\% of the
   parasites located outside the hind stomach and intestine areas. MRI
   demonstrated a capacity to detect A. simplex s.l. accumulations in the
   viscera of whole herring, A. simplex s.l. larvae and their movements
   within fish muscle, and Pseudoterranova sp. larva in fish muscle. Visual
   inspection of herring showed that A. simplex s.l. larvae frequently
   accumulate in the posterior end of the terminal blind sac of the
   stomach, around the ductus pneumaticus, as had previously been reported
   in herring and other clupeids. It has been hypothesized that the food
   digestion process, visceral organ topography and physicochemical
   conditions of fish tissues may play an important role in determining the
   encapsulation site and in vivo migration behaviours of A. simplex s.l.
   larvae within fish hosts. MRI showed potential to investigate the
   occurrence of anisakids and possibly other macro parasites of fish, and
   to detect anisakids in fishery products in situ, in a 3D environment and
   in a noninvasive and non-destructive way. Further investigation is
   required to determine if MRI can be used as a routine anisakid
   inspection tool by the fishing industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Elucidating the adaptive strategies and plasticity of bacterial genomes
   in situ is crucial for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of
   pathogens threatening human health. While much is known about the
   evolution of Escherichia coli in controlled laboratory environments,
   less effort has been made to elucidate the genome dynamics of E. coli in
   its native settings. Here, we follow the genome dynamics of co-existing
   E. coli lineages in situ of the infant gut during the first year of
   life. One E. coli lineage causes a urinary tract infection (UTI) and
   experiences several alterations of its genomic content during subsequent
   antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, all isolates of this uropathogenic
   E. coli strain carried a highly stable plasmid implicated in virulence
   of diverse pathogenic strains from all over the world. While virulence
   elements are certainly beneficial during infection scenarios, their role
   in gut colonization and pathogen persistence is poorly understood. We
   performed in vivo competitive fitness experiments to assess the role of
   this highly disseminated virulence plasmid in gut colonization, but
   found no evidence for a direct benefit of plasmid carriage. Through
   plasmid stability assays, we demonstrate that this plasmid is maintained
   in a parasitic manner, by strong first-line inheritance mechanisms,
   acting on the single-cell level, rather than providing a direct survival
   advantage in the gut. Investigating the ecology of endemic accessory
   genetic elements, in their pathogenic hosts and native environment, is
   of vital importance if we want to understand the evolution and
   persistence of highly virulent and drug resistant bacterial isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites can manipulate host behaviour to increase their own
   transmission and fitness, but the genomic mechanisms by which parasites
   manipulate hosts are not well understood. We investigated the
   relationship between the social paper wasp, Polistes dominula, and its
   parasite, Xenos vesparum (Insecta: Strepsiptera), to understand the
   effects of an obligate endoparasitoid on its host's brain transcriptome.
   Previous research suggests that X. vesparum shifts aspects of host
   social caste-related behaviour and physiology in ways that benefit the
   parasitoid. We hypothesized that X. vesparum-infested (stylopized)
   females would showa shift in caste-related brain gene expression.
   Specifically, we predicted that stylopized females, who would normally
   be workers, would show gene expression patterns resembling
   pre-overwintering queens (gynes), reflecting gyne-like changes in
   behaviour. We used RNA-sequencing data to characterize patterns of brain
   gene expression in stylopized females and compared these with those of
   unstylopized workers and gynes. In support of our hypothesis, we found
   that stylopized females, despite sharing numerous physiological and
   life-history characteristics with members of the worker caste, show
   gyne-shifted brain expression patterns. These data suggest that the
   parasitoid affects its host by exploiting phenotypic plasticity related
   to social caste, thus shifting naturally occurring social behaviour in a
   way that is beneficial to the parasitoid.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms causing size differences of the land hermit crab Coenobita
   rugosus among eco-islands in Southern Taiwan}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Numerous environmental factors can influence body size. Comparing
   populations in different ecological contexts is one potential approach
   to elucidating the most critical of such factors. In the current study,
   we found that the body size of the land hermit crab Coenobita rugosus
   was significantly larger on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea than
   on other eco-islands around Southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this
   could be due to differences in (1) shell resources, (2) parasite impact,
   (3) competition, (4) predation, and (5) food. We found no supporting
   evidence for the first three hypotheses; the shells used by the hermit
   crabs on Dongsha were in poorer condition than were those used
   elsewhere, extremely few individuals in the region had ectoparasites,
   and the density of hermit crabs varied considerably among localities
   within each island. However, significantly higher percentages of C.
   rugosus reached age 3 years on Dongsha than at Siziwan bay in Taiwan.
   Two growth rate indices inferred from size structures suggested faster
   growth on Dongsha than at Siziwan. The condition index (i. e., the body
   mass/shield length ratio of C. rugosus) was also greater on Dongsha than
   at Siziwan. Therefore, Dongsha hermit crabs seem to have superior diet
   and growth performance. Seagrass debris accumulation at the shore of
   Dongsha was considerable, whereas none was observed at Siziwan or on the
   other islands, where dicot leaves were the dominant food item for the
   vegetarian hermit crabs. We then experimentally evaluated the possible
   role of seagrass as food for C. rugosus. The crabs on Dongsha preferred
   seagrass to dicot leaves, and their growth increment was faster when
   they fed on seagrass than when they fed on dicot leaves; no such
   differences were found in the Siziwan hermit crabs. The aforementioned
   results are compatible with the food hypothesis explaining the size
   differences among the islands. The predator hypothesis could explain the
   greater life span but not the other findings. Populations of C. rugosus
   on islands with seagrass debris piles probably contribute more to the
   gene pool of the species because higher proportions of these populations
   could achieve high fecundity. The fate of these terrestrial hermit crabs
   may rely on the health of underwater seagrass ecosystems that are under
   threat from global change.}},

   ticks occurring on red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The red fox Vulpes vulpes is the most common mesocarnivore
   in Europe and with a wide geographical distribution and a high density
   in most terrestrial habitats of the continent. It is fast urbanising
   species, which can harbor high numbers of different tick species,
   depending on the region. Here we present the results of a large-scale
   study, trying to disentangle the intricate relationship between
   environmental factors and the species composition of ectoparasites in
   red foxes. The samples were collected in Transylvania (Romania), a
   region with a diverse geography and high biodiversity. The dead foxes
   (collected primarily through the National Surveillance Rabies Program)
   were examined carefully for the presence of ticks.
   Results: Ticks (n = 4578) were found on 158 foxes (out of 293 examined;
   53.9\%). Four species were identified: Dermacentor marginatus, Ixodes
   canisuga, I. hexagonus and I. ricinus. The most common tick species was
   I. hexagonus (mean prevalence 37.5\%, mean intensity 32.2), followed by
   I. ricinus (15.0\%; 4.86), I. canisuga (4.8\%; 7.71) and D. marginatus
   (3.7\%; 3.45). Co-occurrence of two or more tick species on the same
   host was relatively common (12.6\%), the most common co-occurrence being
   I. hexagonus -I. ricinus. For D. marginatus and I. canisuga the highest
   prevalence was recorded in lowlands, for I. hexagonus in hilly areas,
   while for I. ricinus in mountains.
   Conclusions: Altitude influenced the intensity of parasitism, with
   highest intensity observed for all Ixodes species in hilly areas.
   Dermacentor marginatus occurred only in lowlands, I. canisuga in
   lowlands and hilly areas while the other two species occurred in all of
   the regions studied. Foxes from lower altitudes had the most tick
   species associated, with most incidences of co-parasitism also recorded
   here. Land use affected tick-species composition, with the presence of
   D. marginatus strongly associated with the extension of arable areas and
   lack of forests. The presence of I. hexagonus was determined only by the
   extent of arable lands. As foxes are frontrunners of wildlife
   urbanization process, with a continuous increase of their numbers in
   urban areas, the knowledge of their ticks' ecology (and the pathogens
   vectored by these) is of utmost importance.}},

   (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species from the United States}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biting midges in the genus Culicoides (Diptera;
   Ceratopogonidae) have been implicated in the transmission of a number of
   parasites and highly pathogenic viruses. In North America, the complete
   transmission cycles of many of these pathogens need further elucidation.
   One way to increase our knowledge about the evolution and ecology of
   Culicoides species and the pathogens they transmit is to document the
   diversity of vertebrate hosts that Culicoides feed upon. Our objective
   was to identify the diversity of Culicoides hosts in the United States.
   Results: We sequenced two vertebrate mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 and cytochrome b) from blood-engorged Culicoides to
   identify Culicoides species and their blood meals. We detected the
   mitochondrial DNA of 12 host species from seven different Culicoides
   species from three states. The majority of the identified blood meals
   were from the C. variipennis species complex in California. The hosts
   included both mammals and birds. We documented new host records for some
   of the Culicoides species collected. The majority of the mammalian hosts
   were large ungulate species but we also detected a lagomorph and a
   carnivore. The bird species that were detected included house finch and
   emu; the latter is evidence that the species in the C. variipennis
   species complex are not strictly mammalophilic.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Culicoides will feed on
   multiple classes of vertebrates and may be more opportunistic in regards
   to host choice than previously thought. This knowledge can help with
   identification of susceptible host species, pathogen reservoirs, and new
   vector species which, in turn, will improve disease outbreak risk
   assessments.}},

   snout-vent length (SVL). Females reach sexual maturity at about 460 mm

   between August to October, coinciding with the onset of spermatogenesis.
   Trimeresurus albolabris displays post-nuptial vitellogenesis, and
   long-term sperm storage in females likely occurs over the winter.
   Females gestate over the summer and parturition occurs in late July to
   August. Females reproduce once every two or more years, except for very

   competition between prey species. The second of these has to do with
   splicing evolutionary dynamics into metapopulation models, so as to
   craft hypotheses about how food chain length might be influenced by the
   coevolutionary struggle between predators and their prey. I developed
   simple models of the sort we should have explored together, in the style
   we would have used at the time of our conversations on these themes, in

Abstract = {{We assessed local horn fly (Haematobia irritans L.) and face fly (Musca
   autumnalis De Geer) communities on cattle in 2012 and 2013 relative to
   vegetation and climate data to understand how parasitism of cattle is
   influenced by change in climate and vegetation structure. We compared
   heterogeneity management using spatially and temporally discrete fires
   (i.e., patch-burning one-third of a pasture annually) to homogeneity
   management (i.e., burning entire pasture in 2012 then no burning in
   2013), with cattle grazing all years in both treatments. Predicted
   emergence of horn flies and face flies was 24 and 34 d earlier in 2012
   associated with earlier spring warming, a significant deviation from the
   five-year mean. Intraannual horn fly dynamics were explained by
   concurrent high ambient air temperature the day of observations, but
   face flies were explained by low ambient air temperatures and dry
   conditions 3 wk before observations. Importance values of information
   for the theoretic models including fire treatments ranged from 0.89 to
   1, indicating that both horn flies and face flies are sensitive to
   habitat alterations and fire-driven animal movements. Ordination
   indicates herds on unburned pastures were dissimilar to herds on
   pastures burned with patchy fires or pastures burned completely and
   species-specific fly responses to different vegetation structure
   metrics. For example, horn flies were correlated with vegetation visual
   obstruction, and face flies were correlated with woody plant cover.
   Vegetation structure may be as important as climate in driving the
   dynamics of fly parasites of cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization negatively affects biodiversity, yet some urban habitat
   features can support diversity. Parasitoid wasps, an abundant and highly

   many agricultural habitats, yet few studies have examined diversity and
   abundance of parasitoids in urban agroecosystems to understand how to
   promote conservation and function. We examined the local habitat and
   landscape drivers of parasitoid abundance, superfamily and family
   richness, and parasitoid composition in urban gardens in the California
   central coast. Local factors included garden size, ground cover type,
   herbaceous plant species, and number of trees and shrubs. Landscape
   characteristics included land cover and landscape diversity around
   gardens. We found that garden size, mulch cover, and urban cover within
   500 m of gardens predicted increases in parasitoid abundance within
   gardens. The height of herbaceous vegetation and tree and shrub richness
   predicted increases in superfamily and family richness whereas increases
   in urban cover resulted in declines in parasitoid richness. Abundance of
   individual superfamilies and families responded to a wide array of local
   and landscape factors, sometimes in opposite ways. Composition of
   parasitoid communities responded to changes in garden size, herbaceous
   plant cover, and number of flowers. Thus, both local scale management

Abstract = {{Stingless bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae: Meliponini) represent a highly

   their diversity and functional importance, their ecology, and especially
   chemical ecology, has received relatively little attention, particularly
   compared to their relative the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Here, I review
   various aspects of the chemical ecology of stingless bees, from
   communication over resource allocation to defense. I list examples in
   which functions of specific compounds (or compound groups) have been
   demonstrated by behavioral experiments, and show that many aspects
   (e.g., queen-worker interactions, host-parasite interactions, neuronal
   processing etc.) remain little studied. This review further reveals that
   the vast majority of studies on the chemical ecology of stingless bees
   have been conducted in the New World, whereas studies on Old World
   stingless bees are still comparatively rare. Given the diversity of

Abstract = {{The role of parasites in trophic ecology is poorly understood in marine
   ecosystems. Stable isotope analyses (SIA) have been widely used in
   studies of trophic ecology, but have rarely been applied to study the
   role of parasites. Considering that some parasites are associated with
   altered host foraging patterns, SIA can help elucidate whether
   parasitism influences host trophic interactions. French grunt (Haemulon
   flavolineatum), an abundant Caribbean coral reef fish, contributes
   greatly to trophic connectivity. They typically depart the reef at dusk,
   feed overnight in seagrass beds, and return to the reef at dawn. The
   large parasitic isopod Anilocra haemuli commonly infects French grunt,
   and infected fish are less likely to complete their diel migration, and
   are in poorer condition than uninfected conspecifics. Brown chromis
   (Chromis multilineata) are diurnally feeding planktivores and infection
   by Anilocra chromis does not influence host condition. To determine if
   Anilocra infection influences host diet and foraging locality, we
   conducted stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses on scale, muscle,
   heart and gill tissues of infected and uninfected French grunt and brown
   chromis. We determined that all French grunt had delta C-13 values
   representative of seagrass habitats, but infected French grunt were
   significantly enriched in C-13 and N-15 compared to uninfected
   conspecifics. This suggests that compared to uninfected conspecifics,
   infected French grunt forage in seagrass, but on isotopically enriched
   prey, and/or are in poorer condition, which can elevate delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values. For brown chromis, infection did not significantly
   influence any delta C-13 and delta N-15 values; hence they all foraged
   in the same environment and on similar prey. This is the first study to
   use SIA to examine differences in resource use by Caribbean coral reef
   fishes associated with parasitism and to evaluate how closely related
   parasites might have host-dependent effects on host trophic ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have investigated
   antagonistic co-evolution between parasites and their hosts. Although
   experimental tests of theory from a range of biological systems are
   largely concordant regarding the influence of several driving processes,
   we know little as to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales
   (individual molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the
   emergence of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary
   dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods commonly
   employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community
   interaction matrices, so-called bipartite networks, reflected observed
   co-evolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or
   may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a
   consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously
   demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary dynamics and the other
   fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host
   ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a
   trade-off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms
   race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence
   that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in
   the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria
   co-evolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local
   adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with
   type IV pili. We conclude that the structure of phage-bacteria
   interaction networks is not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary
   dynamics, and discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was,
   nevertheless, locally adapted.}},

Title = {{Aphid Heritable Symbiont Exploits Defensive Mutualism}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Insects and other animals commonly form symbioses with heritable
   bacteria, which can exert large influences on host biology and ecology.
   The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is a model for studying effects of
   infection with heritable facultative symbionts (HFS), and each of its
   seven common HFS species has been reported to provide resistance to
   biotic or abiotic stresses. However, one common HFS, called X-type,
   rarely occurs as a single infection in field populations and instead
   typically superinfects individual aphids with Hamiltonella defensa,
   another HFS that protects aphids against attack by parasitic wasps.
   Using experimental aphid lines comprised of all possible infection
   combinations in a uniform aphid genotype, we investigated whether the
   most common strain of X-type provides any of the established benefits
   associated with aphid HFS as a single infection or superinfection with
   H. defensa. We found that X-type does not confer protection to any
   tested threats, including parasitoid wasps, fungal pathogens, or thermal
   stress. Instead, component fitness assays identified large costs
   associated with X-type infection, costs which were ameliorated in
   superinfected aphids. Together these findings suggest that X-type
   exploits the aphid/H. defensa mutualism and is maintained primarily as a
   superinfection by ``hitchhiking{''} via the mutualistic benefits
   provided by another HFS. Exploitative symbionts potentially restrict the
   functions and distributions of mutualistic symbioses with effects that
   extend to other community members.
   IMPORTANCE Maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts are widespread and
   can have major impacts on the biology of arthropods, including insects
   of medical and agricultural importance. Given that host fitness and
   symbiont fitness are tightly linked, inherited symbionts can spread
   within host populations by providing beneficial services. Many insects,
   however, are frequently infected with multiple heritable symbiont
   species, providing potential alternative routes of symbiont maintenance.
   Here we show that a common pea aphid symbiont called X-type likely
   employs an exploitative strategy of hitchhiking off the benefits of a
   protective symbiont, Hamiltonella. Infection with X-type provides none
   of the benefits conferred by other aphid symbionts and instead results
   in large fitness costs, costs lessened by superinfection with
   Hamiltonella. These findings are corroborated by natural infections in
   field populations, where X-type is mostly found superinfecting aphids
   with Hamiltonella. Exploitative symbionts may be common in hosts with
   communities of heritable symbionts and serve to hasten the breakdown of
   mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of blood parasite infection in nestling birds rarely find a high

   and long parasite prepatent periods before gametocytes can be detected
   in peripheral blood. Here we examine rates of blood parasite infection
   in nestlings from three Columbid species in the UK. We use this system
   to address two key hypotheses in the epidemiology of avian
   haemoparasites: first, that nestlings in open nests have a higher
   prevalence of infection; and second, that nestlings sampled at 14 days
   old have a higher apparent infection rate than those sampled at 7 days
   old. Open-nesting individuals had a 54\% infection rate compared with
   25\% for box-nesters, probably due to an increased exposure of
   open-nesting species to dipteran vectors. Nestlings sampled at 14 days
   had a 68\% infection rate compared with 32\% in nestlings sampled at 7
   days, suggesting that rates of infection in the nest are high. Further

Abstract = {{The population growth of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) is
   not consistent with species recovery goals, and the impact of parasite
   infection on whooping crane populations is largely unknown. Disease
   ecology and epidemiology research of endangered species is often
   hindered by limited ability to conduct invasive sampling on the target
   taxa. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sandhill cranes (Grus
   canadensis) would be a useful surrogate species to investigate the
   health impacts of Haemosporida infection in whooping cranes. Our goal
   was to compare the prevalence and diversity of Haemosporida infection
   between whooping cranes and sandhill cranes. We detected an overall
   infection prevalence of 83.6\% (n = 61) in whooping cranes and 59.6\% (n
   = 47) and 63.6 (n = 22) in two sympatric sandhill crane populations
   captured in Texas. Prevalence was significantly lower in allopatric
   sandhill cranes captured in New Mexico (12.1\%, n = 33). Haemoproteus
   antigonis was the most abundant haemoparasite in cranes, present in
   57.4\% of whooping cranes and 39.2\% of sandhill cranes; Plasmodium and
   Leucocytozoon were present at significantly lower levels. The high
   prevalence of Haemosporida in whooping cranes and sympatric sandhill
   cranes, with shared parasite lineages between the two species, supports
   sandhill cranes as a surrogate species for understanding health threats
   to endangered whooping cranes.}},

Abstract = {{The crowding effect' is a result of competition by parasites within a
   host for finite resources. Typically, the severity of this effect
   increases with increasing numbers of parasites within a host and
   manifests in reduced body size and thus fitness. Evidence for the
   crowding effect is mixed - while some have found negative effects,
   others have found a positive effect of increased parasite load on
   parasite fitness. Parasites are consumers with diverse trophic
   strategies reflected in their life history traits. These distinctions
   are useful to predict the effects of crowding. We studied a parasitic
   castrator, a parasite that usurps host reproductive energy and renders
   the host sterile. Parasitic castrators typically occur as single
   infections within hosts. With multiple parasitic castrators, we expect
   strong competition and evidence of crowding. We directly assess the
   effect of crowding on reproductive success in a barnacle population
   infected by a unique parasitic castrator, Hemioniscus balani, an isopod
   parasite that infects and blocks reproduction of barnacles. We find (1)
   strong evidence of crowding in double infections, (2) increased
   frequency of double infections in larger barnacle hosts with more
   resources and (3) perfect compensation in egg production, supporting
   strong space limitation. Our results document that the effects of
   crowding are particularly severe for this parasitic castrator, and may
   be applicable to other castrators that are also resource or space
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{Species co-occurrence in ecological communities is thought to be
   influenced by multiple ecological and evolutionary processes, especially
   colonization and competition. However, effects of other interspecific
   interactions and evolutionary relationships are less explored. We
   examined evolutionary histories of community members and roles of
   mutualistic and parasitic interactions (Mullerian and Batesian mimicry,
   respectively) in the assembly of mimetic butterfly communities called
   mimicry rings in tropical forests of the Western Ghats, India. We found
   that Mullerian mimics were phylogenetically clustered, sharing
   aposematic signals due to common ancestry. On the other hand, Batesian
   mimics joined mimicry rings through convergent evolution and random
   phylogenetic assembly. Since the Western Ghats are a habitat island, we
   compared species diversity and composition in its mimicry rings with
   those of habitat mainland to test effects of biogeographic connectivity.
   The Western Ghats consisted of fewer mimicry rings and an overall
   smaller number of aposematic species and mimics compared to habitat
   mainland. The depauperate mimicry rings in the Western Ghats could have
   resulted from stochastic processes, reflecting their long temporal and
   spatial isolation and trickling colonization by the mimetic butterfly
   communities. These results highlight how evolutionary history,

Abstract = {{Many brood parasites rely on mimicry to prevent the detection of their
   eggs by hosts, yet most Australasian cuckoo species lay darkly colored
   eggs while the eggs of their hosts are pale and speckled. In the dimly
   lit nests of their hosts, these cuckoo eggs may appear cryptic; however,
   it is unclear if this disguise has evolved to fool hosts or other
   cuckoos. Recent work suggests that in at least one species of
   bronze-cuckoo, cuckoos are more likely to reject conspicuous eggs than
   are hosts, but it remains unclear whether this is common across the
   species group. Here, we present field experiments on the sole host of
   the Shining Bronze-Cuckoo (Chalcites lucidus lucidus) in New Zealand,
   the Grey Gerygone (Gerygone igata; known locally as the Grey Warbler),
   that explored whether this host ignores cuckoo eggs because they are
   cryptic. Using an avian vision model, we showed that Shining
   Bronze-Cuckoo eggs were variable in their conspicuousness, but were more
   cryptic in host nests than the host's eggs. We then experimentally
   parasitized all available clutches with model eggs that mimicked darkly
   or brightly colored cuckoo eggs, or were of maximum conspicuousness
   (white) as determined by visual modeling. Hosts never rejected our model
   eggs, nor cuckoo eggs when naturally parasitized. Instead, only cuckoos
   rejected model eggs: In 3 out of 4 experimental nests that were
   subsequently parasitized, the model egg was taken and replaced by a
   cuckoo's egg. Together, these data and previous experiments suggest that
   competition among cuckoos, rather than rejection by hosts, provides a
   stronger selection pressure for the evolution of cryptic eggs across the
   genus Chalcites.}},

Abstract = {{Kin selection theory predicts that extrapair mating should be rare in

   complicated by a lack of data. The majority of cooperatively breeding
   birds live in the tropics, and their genetic mating systems are little

   ( Agelaioides badius), a socially monogamous Neotropical blackbird in
   which most nesting pairs are assisted by helpers, previously assumed to
   be offspring of the breeding pair. Grayish Baywings are the primary host
   of the parasitic Screaming Cowbird ( Molothrus rufoaxillaris), and
   previous studies have found a positive association between brood
   parasitism and helper recruitment in the last part of the nestling
   period. We used microsatellite markers to analyze the kinship of 192
   individuals in 47 breeding groups, finding that 13\% of 153 nestlings (

   2 instances of conspecific brood parasitism and 1 instance of
   quasiparasitism ( the nestling was sired by the social father, but was
   unrelated to the social mother). Of 8 helpers that were genotyped, 4 (
   all males) were offspring of the breeding pair and 4 ( 2 males, 2
   females) were unrelated to both members of the breeding pair. None of
   the helpers produced offspring within the clutch. These results suggest
   that, although cooperative breeding is frequent, genetic relatedness
   between Grayish Baywing helpers and the offspring that they raise is
   highly variable. Future studies are needed to determine why unrelated
   helpers assist at Grayish Baywing nests, and to understand the role that
   brood parasitism may have played in the evolution of cooperative

   difficult in African areas with initial prevalences in excess of 55\%,
   especially if only annual treatments are dispensed. This is partly

   Plants showed no adaptation to the local soil environment in the absence

   resistance against local pathogens was higher when plants were grown in

   We conclude that below-ground biotic heterogeneity mediates above-ground

   special reference to the role of chemical signals in males. We reviewed
   the current knowledge on mosquito sexual chemical ecology and other key
   cues affecting courtship and mating behavior. The information available

   tactile cues perceived during swarming and mate. On the other hand, more

Abstract = {{Climate change can have critical impacts on the ecological role of

   The consequences of climate change may be best predicted by
   understanding its interaction with the cumulative effects of other
   stressors, although this approach is rarely adopted. However, whether
   this interaction is additive or interactive can hardly be predicted from
   studies examining a single factor at a time. In particular, biotic
   interactions are known to induce modifications in the functional role of
   many species. Here, we explored the effect of temperature on leaf
   consumption by a keystone freshwater shredder, the amphipod Gammarus
   fossarum. This species is found at high densities in the wild and relies
   on aggregation as an antipredator behavior. In addition, gammarids
   regularly harbor acanthocephalan parasites that are known to induce
   multiple effects on their hosts, including modifications on their
   functional role. We thus assessed the cumulative effect of both
   intraspecific interactions and parasitism. Consumption tests were
   conducted on gammarids, either naturally infected with Pomphorhynchus
   tereticollis or uninfected, feeding alone or in groups. Our results show
   that increased temperatures induced a significant increase in
   consumption, but only to a certain extent. Interestingly, consumption at
   the highest temperature depended on amphipod density: Whereas a decrease
   was observed for single individuals, no such effect on feeding was
   observed for individuals in groups. In addition, infection by
   acanthocephalan parasites per se significantly negatively impacted the
   shredding role of gammarids. Overall, the combined effects of parasitism
   and temperature appeared to be additive. Thus, future studies focusing
   on the impact of climate change on the functional role of keystone
   species may benefit from a multimodal approach under realistic

Abstract = {{Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease exhibits significant
   genetic diversity. This parasite is divided into six discrete typing
   units (DTUs) where T. cruzi I (TcI) is the most widespread in the
   Americas. TcI genotypes have been associated to domestic and sylvatic
   cycles of transmission (TcIDom and sylvatic TcI). Due to the importance
   of the enzootic transmission, we determined the frequency of TcI
   genotypes present in Rhodnius prolixus captured in different regions of
   the palm A. butyracea to understand the ecology of the disease and the
   importance of A. butyracea palms as ecotopes of R. prolixus. Forty A.
   butyracea palms were sampled (base crown, mid-point and crown) capturing
   105 individuals identified as R. prolixus by morphological and molecular
   barcoding. We conducted molecular detection and typing of T. cruzi
   across 59 individuals. The results showed that all the insects were
   infected with TcI; 28.57\% were sylvatic TcI, 12.38\% TcIDom and 15,24\%
   mixed infections (TcIDom/sylvatic TcI). Statistical analysis showed a
   similar behavior between TcIDom and mixed infections in the mid-point
   and at the crown of the palm, being more frequent in the crown, while
   sylvatic TcI does not seem to have a specific association with any of
   the sampled areas. These findings are consistent with other studies
   showing high mobility of the insect vector between different ecotopes,
   increasing the need to develop improvements in the programs of disease
   control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{34-41}},

Abstract = {{Root knot nematodes (RKN) cause major losses in tomato. Some strains of
   Streptomyces are known to prevent RKN disease in plants, but little
   attention has been given to their biocontrol effects in crops such as
   tomato. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to assess the
   effects of a Streptomyces agent (1:1 mixture of S. pactum and S. Rochei)
   for biocontrol of RKN disease in tomato. We quantified endophytes in
   tomato roots, as well as microbes and nematodes in root zone soil with
   or without inoculation of Streptomyces. Additionally; we measured the
   plant biomass and physiobiochemical traits of tomato at different growth
   stages. The results showed that after inoculation of Streptomyces: (i)
   The RKN disease index of tomato plants decreased by 37\%. The quantity
   of bacterial-feeding nematodes decreased by 14\% in root zone soil,
   while the quantity of fungal-feeding and plant parasitic nematodes
   increased by 10\% and 137\%, respectively. (ii) The fresh weight of
   shoot and root increased by 14\% and 35\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the
   polyphenol oxidase activity of leaves increased by 33\% at the seedling
   stage. (iii) The total number of culturable bacteria decreased by 49\%
   in root knots. Regarding the total number of culturable microbes in root
   zone soil, bacteria and actinomycetes also decreased by 18\% and 10\%,
   respectively, whereas fungi increased by 20\%. Moreover, the quantity of
   both plant growth-promoting bacteria and nematicidal bacteria increased,
   while the quantity of plant-pathogenic bacteria decreased. In
   conclusion, the Streptomyces agent could reduce RKN disease in tomato by
   activating the systemic resistance and defensive mechanism against
   nematode infection. This agent triggered complex interactions between
   plants, microbes, and nematodes in the micro-ecosystem of root zone
   soil, resulting in decreased RKN infection ability and/or enhanced
   tomato disease resistance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the ecosystem function of high-order predators is critical
   for evaluation of food web interactions. Insectivorous birds are
   abundant predators in many ecosystems yet because they forage upon small
   taxa, it remains largely unknown whether birds are providing ecosystem
   services in the form of pest control or disservices by preying upon
   predaceous arthropod species. We extracted DNA from noninvasive fecal
   samples of adult and nestling Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) in
   California vineyards. Using universal arthropod-specific primers, we
   sequenced prey items via massively parallel sequencing on the Illumina
   MiSeq platform. Bluebirds consumed a broad diet comprising 66 unique
   arthropod species from 6 orders and 28 families. Aedes sp. (mosquitoes:
   Culicidae), a previously unknown prey, was the most common item
   recovered, occurring in 49.5\% of the fecal samples. Ectoparasitic bird
   blowfly (Protocalliphora) DNA was found in 7\% of adult and 11\% of
   nestling samples, presenting clear evidence of active feeding by the
   avian hosts on adult or larval ectoparasites. Herbivorous insects,
   primarily from the orders Hemiptera and Lepidoptera, represented over
   half (56\%) of the prey items in bluebird diets. Intraguild predation
   (consumption of predator or parasitoid arthropods) represented only 3\%
   of adult and nestling dietary items. Diets of adults were significantly
   different from nestlings as were diets from birds sampled in different
   vineyard blocks. Sex, date, number of young, and individual bird (based
   on resampled individuals) were all insignificant factors that did not
   explain diet variability. Nestling age was a significant factor in
   explaining a small amount of the variability in dietary components. In
   addition, our analysis of subsampling larger fecal samples and
   processing them independently revealed highly dissimilar results in all
   10 trials and we recommend avoiding this common methodology. Molecular
   scatology offers powerfully informative techniques that can reveal the

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The eco-epidemiological scenario of spotted fever (SF), a tick-borne
   disease that affects humans and other animals in several countries
   around the world, was analyzed in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) State, Brazil.
   During the last 34 years, 990 SF cases were reported in RJ (the
   Brazilian state with the highest population density), including 116
   cases confirmed by serology (RIFI) or PCR, among 42.39\% of the
   municipalities with reported cases of SF. The epidemiologic dynamics of
   SF in RJ State are very heterogeneous in time and space, with outbreaks,
   high mortality rates and periods of epidemiological silence (no SF cases
   reported). Furthermore, it exhibited a changing epidemiological profile
   from being rural to becoming an urban disease. This study identified
   arthropods infected with Rickettsia felis, R. bellii and R. rickettsii,
   and found that the abundance of ectoparasites was associated with
   specific hosts. The R. rickettsii-vector-host relationship was most
   evident in species-specific parasitism. This suggests that the
   association between dogs, cattle, horses, capybaras and their main
   ectoparasites, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ctenocephalides felis,
   Rhipicephalus microplus, Dermacentor nitens, and Amblyomma dubitatum,
   respectively, has a key role in the dynamics of R. rickettsii
   transmission in enzootic cycles and the maintenance of carrier
   ectoparasites, thus facilitating the existence of endemic areas with the
   ability to produce epidemic outbreaks of SF in RJ. This study found
   confirmed human infections for only the R. rickettsii carrier Amblyomma
   sculptum, which reinforces the importance of this species as a vector of
   the pathogen in Brazil. This study can be adapted to different
   eco-epidemiological scenarios of spotted fever throughout the Americas.}},

Title = {{Coinfection outcome in an opportunistic pathogen depends on the
   inter-strain interactions}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: In nature, organisms are commonly coinfected by two or more
   parasite strains, which has been shown to influence disease virulence.
   Yet, the effects of coinfections of environmental opportunistic
   pathogens on disease outcome are still poorly known, although as
   host-generalists they are highly likely to participate in coinfections.
   We asked whether coinfection with conspecific opportunistic strains
   leads to changes in virulence, and if these changes are associated with
   bacterial growth or interference competition. We infected zebra fish
   (Danio rerio) with three geographically and/or temporally distant
   environmental opportunist Flavobacterium columnare strains in single and
   in coinfection. Growth of the strains was studied in single and in
   co-cultures in liquid medium, and interference competition
   (growth-inhibiting ability) on agar.
   Results: The individual strains differed in their virulence, growth and
   ability for interference competition. Number of coinfecting strains
   significantly influenced the virulence of infection, with three-strain
   coinfection differing from the two-strain and single infections.
   Differences in virulence seemed to associate with the identity of the
   coinfecting bacterial strains, and their pairwise interactions. This
   indicates that benefits of competitive ability (production of
   growth-inhibiting compounds) for virulence are highest when multiple
   strains co-occur, whereas the high virulence in coinfection may be
   independent from in vitro bacterial growth.
   Conclusions: Intraspecific competition can lead to plastic increase in
   virulence, likely caused by faster utilization of host resources
   stimulated by the competitive interactions between the strains. However,
   disease outcome depends both on the characteristics of individual
   strains and their interactions. Our results highlight the importance of
   strain interactions in disease dynamics in environments where various
   pathogen genotypes co-occur.}},

Volume = {{416}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the drivers of parasite evolution and in particular
   disease virulence remains a major focus of evolutionary theory. Here, we
   examine the role of resource quality and in particular spatial
   environmental heterogeneity in the distribution of these resources on
   the evolution of virulence. There may be direct effects of resources on
   host susceptibility and pathogenicity alongside effects on reproduction
   that indirectly impact host parasite population dynamics. Therefore, we
   assume that high resource quality may lead to both increased host
   reproduction and/or increased disease resistance. In completely mixed
   populations there is no effect of resource quality on the outcome of
   disease evolution. However, when there are local interactions higher
   resource quality generally selects for higher virulence/transmission for
   both linear and saturating transmission-virulence tradeoff assumptions.
   The exception is that in castrators (i.e., infected hosts have no
   reproduction), higher virulence is selected for both low and high
   resource qualities at mixed local and global infection. Heterogeneity in
   the distribution of environment resources only has an effect on the
   outcome in castrators where random distributions generally select for
   higher virulence. Overall, our results further underline the importance

Title = {{Exo-erythrocytic development of avian malaria and related haemosporidian
   parasites}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related
   haemosporidians (Haemosporida) are responsible for diseases which can be
   severe and even lethal in avian hosts. These parasites cause not only
   blood pathology, but also damage various organs due to extensive
   exo-erythrocytic development all over the body, which is not the case
   during Plasmodium infections in mammals. However, exo-erythrocytic
   development (tissue merogony or schizogony) remains the most poorly
   investigated part of life cycle in all groups of wildlife haemosporidian
   parasites. In spite of remarkable progress in studies of genetic
   diversity, ecology and evolutionary biology of avian haemosporidians
   during the past 20 years, there is not much progress in understanding
   patterns of exo-erythrocytic development in these parasites. The purpose
   of this review is to overview the main information on exo-erythrocytic
   development of avian Plasmodium species and related haemosporidian
   parasites as a baseline for assisting academic and veterinary medicine
   researchers in morphological identification of these parasites using
   tissue stages, and to define future research priorities in this field of
   avian malariology.
   Methods: The data were considered from peer-reviewed articles and
   histological material that was accessed in zoological collections in
   museums of Australia, Europe and the USA. Articles describing tissue
   stages of avian haemosporidians were included from 1908 to the present.
   Histological preparations of various organs infected with the
   exo-erythrocytic stages of different haemosporidian parasites were
   examined.
   Results: In all, 229 published articles were included in this review.
   Exo-erythrocytic stages of avian Plasmodium, Fallisia, Haemoproteus,
   Leucocytozoon, and Akiba species were analysed, compared and
   illustrated. Morphological characters of tissue stages that can be used
   for diagnostic purposes were specified.
   Conclusion: Recent molecular studies combined with histological research
   show that avian haemosporidians are more virulent than formerly
   believed. The exo-erythrocytic stages can cause severe disease,
   especially in non-adapted avian hosts, suggesting the existence of a
   group of underestimated malignant infections. The development of a given
   haemosporidian strain can be markedly different in different avian
   hosts, resulting in significantly different virulence. A methodology
   combining the traditional histology techniques with molecular diagnostic
   tools is essential to speed research in this field of avian malariology.}},

   evidence from published literature about factors affecting population
   dynamics of bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), augmented by local

   several factors and relationships not in evidence in the other. For
   example, stakeholders identified 3 secondary factors alleged to affect
   bobolink habitat quantity on breeding grounds not identified in the
   literature: tree planting incentives, green energy incentives, and crop
   values. These and other structural uncertainties in the management
   systems are made transparent using DAGs, facilitating communication and

Abstract = {{We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of parasites in
   biological invasions by alien species. Parasites have frequently been
   invoked as drivers of invasions, but have received less attention as
   invasion passengers. The evidence to date that parasites drive invasions
   by hosts is weak: while there is abundant evidence that parasites have
   effects in the context of alien invasions, there is little evidence to
   suggest that parasites have differential effects on alien species that
   succeed versus fail in the invasion process. Particular case studies are
   suggestive but not yet informative about general effects. What evidence
   there is for parasites as aliens suggests that the same kind of factors
   determine their success as for non-parasites. Thus, availability is
   likely to be an important determinant of the probability of
   translocation. Establishment and spread are likely to depend on
   propagule pressure and on the environment being suitable (all necessary
   hosts and vectors are present); the likelihood of both of these
   dependencies being favourable will be affected by traits relating to
   parasite life history and demography. The added complication for the
   success of parasites as aliens is that often this will depend on the
   success of their hosts. We discuss how these conclusions help us to
   understand the likely effects of parasites on the success of
   establishing host populations (alien or native).}},

   Here we compare host reproductive condition to gill parasite infection
   load in Fantail Darters (Etheostoma flabellare) of Mill Creek,
   Tennessee, USA, over the course of a year. We sought to determine
   whether host reproductive season or condition correlated with parasite
   load, whether parasite load differed between host sexes, and whether
   parasite load correlated with clutch size in females. We sampled the
   host population bimonthly and measured host physical and reproductive
   characteristics and gill parasite load. Infection levels significantly
   decreased when host reproductive activity ceased. Parasite load did not
   correlate strongly with body size in either sex. Male hosts were
   significantly more heavily infected than female hosts. No negative

   in either sex. However, a significant positive correlation was observed
   between host clutch size and intensity of parasite infection in females,
   even when controlling for body size. The immunocompetence handicap
   hypothesis suggests that sex differences in parasite infection levels
   may be due to an immune defense cost incurred by males as a result of
   androgen-mediated reproductive effort. Females may have evolved a
   compensatory response to heavy parasite infection in which they shift

   Cephalonomia waterstoni Gahan (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) is a natural
   enemy of the rusty grain beetle Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens)
   (Coleoptera: Cucujidae). In the stored product environment, stimuli
   deriving from plant products, damaged plant products and hosts might be
   important for host location by the parasitoids. We tested the response
   of female parasitoids to odours deriving from infested and uninfested
   plant products, the grain dust produced by feeding primary pests, and
   various life stages of the rusty grain beetle. The olfactory response of
   C waterstoni was found to be strongly elicited both by chemicals emitted
   by the dust, adult C. waterstoni and C. waterstoni third and fourth

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{56-66}},

Abstract = {{Successful establishment of invasive species requires that the species
   meet environmental conditions favouring their longevity and fecundity.
   When juveniles and adults consume different resources, gravid females
   may have to choose whether to feed or to reproduce. We used a successful
   invasive species to test whether female life history traits are affected
   by the potential nutrients found in reproductive sites. The pest
   species, Drosophila suzukii, lays eggs in fruits that could provide
   nutrients since fruit exudates are generated during oviposition. We
   demonstrated that D. suzukii adults cannot survive when they have only
   access to reproductive sites (i.e. undamaged fruits). But they can find
   the nutrients necessary for longevity on these reproductive sites if
   there are larger holes in the exocarp. Egg maturation is low when D.
   suzukii feeds on nutrients from fruits, even when damaged, suggesting
   that females cannot acquire sufficient nutrients for egg maturation
   where they lay their eggs. Finally, a field experiment supported our
   laboratory results: wild females have a low degree of egg maturation,
   even when captured near reproductive sites. Our study hence shows
   constraints on egg production, and therefore on fruit infestation,
   determined by the nutritional ecology of pest females. (C) 2016

   analyze the potential effects of host tree deciduousness on the life
   cycle of a mistletoe. Thus, Struthanthus martianus Dettke \& Waechter
   was analyzed while growing upon a deciduous host tree and upon an
   evergreen one. We also compared the phenology of S. martianus with that
   of a closely related and sympatric species, Struthanthus flexicaulis

   host. Reproductive and vegetative phenological events were recorded

   deciduousness, as the population infesting a deciduous host showed
   significant leaf flush during host defoliation. When comparing S.
   martianus and S. flexicaulis, nearly opposite patterns of flowering and
   fruiting phenology were recorded. Based on these observations, we

Abstract = {{Brassolines are among the largest Neotropical butterflies, with large

   co- occurring brassolines show striking similarities in wing traits to
   the extent that mimicry within the tribe has been suggested. When adults

   uncover similarities derived from common descent. Here, evidence for
   future phylogenies to support Selenophanes relatedness to either
   Opsiphanes or Catoblepia are provided by comparing novel molecular (
   barcode sequence) and morphological ( immature) data. While barcoding
   showed Selenophanes sequences to be nested within Catoblepia, with
   intergeneric distances smaller than between Catoblepia species, the
   state of the art of immature morphological descriptions showed that
   Catoblepia and Opsiphanes were more similar than either were to
   Selenophanes. Despite their popularity, brassolines are difficult to

   Nothobranchius that inhabit annually desiccating pools across the
   African savannah and survive the dry period as developmentally arrested
   embryos. Their discontinuous, non-overlapping generations make them a
   unique organism in which to study natural parasite fauna. We
   investigated the relationship between global (climate and altitude) and
   local (pool size, vegetation, host density and diversity, and diversity
   of potential intermediate hosts) environmental factors and the community
   structure of killifish parasites. We examined metazoan parasites from 21
   populations of four host species (Nothobranchius orthonotus, N.furzeri,
   N.kadleci, and N.pienaari) across a gradient of aridity in Mozambique.
   Seventeen parasite taxa were recorded, with trematode larval stages
   (metacercariae) being the most abundant taxa. The parasites recorded
   were both allogenic (life cycle includes non-aquatic host; predominantly
   trematodes) and autogenic (cycling only in aquatic hosts; nematodes).
   The parasite abundance was highest in climatic regions with intermediate
   aridity, while parasite diversity was associated with local
   environmental characteristics and positively correlated with fish
   species diversity and the amount of aquatic vegetation. Our results
   suggest that parasite communities of sympatric Nothobranchius species
   are similar and dominated by the larval stages of generalist parasites.
   Therefore, Nothobranchius serve as important intermediate or paratenic
   hosts of parasites, with piscivorous birds and predatory fish being
   their most likely definitive hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Few hosts have many parasites while many hosts have few parasites. This
   axiom of macroparasite aggregation is so pervasive it is considered a
   general law in disease ecology, with important implications for the
   dynamics of host-parasite systems. Because of these -dynamical
   implications, a significant amount of work has explored both the various
   mechanisms leading to parasite aggregation patterns and how to infer
   mechanism from these patterns. However, as many disease mechanisms can
   produce similar aggregation patterns, it is not clear whether
   aggregation itself provides any additional information about mechanism.
   Here we apply a ``constraint-based{''} approach developed in
   macroecology that allows us to explore whether parasite aggregation
   contains any additional information beyond what is provided by mean
   parasite load. We tested two constraint-based null models, both of which
   were constrained on the total number of parasites P and hosts H found in
   a sample, using data from 842 observed amphibian host-trematode parasite
   distributions. We found that constraint-based models captured similar to
   85\% of the observed variation in host-parasite distributions,
   suggesting that the constraints P and H contain much of the information
   about the shape of the host-parasite distribution. However, we also
   found that extending the constraint-based null models can identify the
   potential role of known aggregating mechanisms (such as host
   heterogeneity) and disaggregating mechanisms (such as parasite-induced
   host mortality) in constraining host-parasite distributions. Thus, by
   providing robust null models, constraint-based approaches can help guide
   investigations aimed at detecting biological processes that directly
   affect parasite aggregation above and beyond those that indirectly
   affect aggregation through P and H.}},

   it is a long lasting formulation or repeatedly administered. In turn,
   this will help also to control neglected infectious diseases where the

   several infectious diseases reveals the benefit of integrating control
   programs against several infectious diseases into one strategy for cost
   effectiveness and to reach the elimination goals. The use of ivermectin

   horizontal transmission of heterologous viruses}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Non-self recognition is a common phenomenon among organisms; it often
   leads to innate immunity to prevent the invasion of parasites and
   maintain the genetic polymorphism of organisms. Fungal vegetative
   incompatibility is a type of non-self recognition which often induces
   programmed cell death (PCD) and restricts the spread of molecular
   parasites. It is not clearly known whether virus infection could
   attenuate non-self recognition among host individuals to facilitate its
   spread. Here, we report that a hypovirulence-associated mycoreovirus,
   named Sclerotinia sclerotiorum mycoreovirus 4 (SsMYRV4), could suppress
   host non-self recognition and facilitate horizontal transmission of
   heterologous viruses. We found that cell death in intermingled colony
   regions between SsMYRV4-infected Sclerotinia sclerotiorum strain and
   other tested vegetatively incompatible strains was markedly reduced and
   inhibition barrage lines were not clearly observed. Vegetative
   incompatibility, which involves Heterotrimeric guanine
   nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) signaling pathway, is
   controlled by specific loci termed het (heterokaryon incompatibility)
   loci. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in vegetative
   incompatibility-mediated PCD. The expression of G protein subunit genes,
   het genes, and ROS-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and
   cellular production of ROS was suppressed in the presence of SsMYRV4.
   Furthermore, SsMYRV4-infected strain could easily accept other viruses
   through hyphal contact and these viruses could be efficiently
   transmitted from SsMYRV4-infected strain to other vegetatively
   incompatible individuals. Thus, we concluded that SsMYRV4 is capable of

Abstract = {{Animal phyla vary dramatically in species richness (from one species to
   >1.2 million), but the causes of this variation remain largely unknown.
   Animals have also evolved striking variation in morphology and ecology,
   including sessile marine taxa lacking heads, eyes, limbs, and complex
   organs (e.g., sponges), parasitic worms (e.g., nematodes,
   platyhelminths), and taxa with eyes, skeletons, limbs, and complex
   organs that dominate terrestrial ecosystems (arthropods, chordates).
   Relating this remarkable variation in traits to the diversification and
   richness of animal phyla is a fundamental yet unresolved problem in
   biology. Here, we test the impacts of 18 traits (including morphology,
   ecology, reproduction, and development) on diversification and richness
   of extant animal phyla. Using phylogenetic multiple regression, the
   best-fitting model includes five traits that explain approximate to 74\%
   of the variation in diversification rates (dioecy, parasitism,
   eyes/photoreceptors, a skeleton, nonmarine habitat). However, a model
   including just three (skeleton, parasitism, habitat) explains nearly as
   much variation (approximate to 67\%). Diversification rates then largely
   explain richness patterns. Our results also identify many striking
   traits that have surprisingly little impact on diversification (e.g.,
   head, limbs, and complex circulatory and digestive systems). Overall,
   our results reveal the key factors that shape large-scale patterns of
   diversification and richness across >80\% of all extant, described

Abstract = {{Understanding how different ecological and evolutionary processes
   influence the distribution of pathogens within the environment is
   important from many perspectives including wildlife epidemiology,
   evolutionary ecology and conservation. The simultaneous use of
   ecological and evolutionary frameworks can enhance our conceptual
   understanding of host-parasite interactions, however such studies are
   rare in the wild. Using samples from 12 bird species caught across all
   habitats existing on an oceanic island, we evaluated how environmental
   variables, parasite host specificity and parasite phylogenetic
   relationships determine the distribution and prevalence of
   haemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon) in the wild
   living avifauna. Differences were found in the prevalence of Plasmodium,
   but not Leucocytozoon, strains between habitats. The warmest temperature
   best predicted Plasmodium prevalence in the low altitude habitats, which
   had the highest incidence of Plasmodium. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon
   lineages was associated with natural factors, i.e. rainfall, temperature
   and habitat, but the two most important predictors (from model
   averaging) for models of Leucocytozoon were anthropogenic: poultry farms
   and distance to a water reservoir. We found no relationship between
   local (Tenerife, Canary Islands) versus global host range indices (which
   assess the diversity of hosts that a parasite is observed to infect),
   thus global generalist lineages do not behave in the same way on
   Tenerife (i.e. they infected less avian hosts than was expected).
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most abundant haemosporidians on
   Tenerife grouped with lineages found in African host species. Our data
   indicate that climatic and anthropogenic factors, plus proximity to the
   African mainland, are the main factors influencing the presence and
   distribution of avian haemosporidians on Tenerife. Future climate
   projections for the archipelago foresee significant temperature
   increases which would, given our results, increase rates of Plasmodium
   infection in bird species in all habitats. Such patterns could be of
   concern if those increase mortality rates in the unique avifauna of
   these islands. (C) 2017 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{305-315}},

Abstract = {{1. Leaf litter subsidies are important resources for aquatic consumers
   like tadpoles and snails, causing bottom-up effects on wetland
   ecosystems. Recent studies have shown that variation in litter
   nutritional quality can be as important as litter quantity in driving
   these bottom-up effects. Resource subsidies likely also have indirect
   and trait-mediated effects on predation and parasitism, but these
   potential effects remain largely unexplored.
   2. We generated predictions for differential effects of litter nutrition
   and secondary polyphenolic compounds on tadpole (Lithobates sylvatica)
   exposure and susceptibility to Ribeiroia ondatrae, based on ecological
   stoichiometry and community-ecology theory. We predicted direct and
   indirect effects on key traits of the tadpole host (rates of growth,
   development and survival), the trematode parasite (production of the
   cercaria infective stages) and the parasite's snail intermediate host
   (growth and reproduction).
   3. To test these predictions, we conducted a large-scale mesocosm
   experiment using a natural gradient in the concentrations of nutrients
   (nitrogen) and toxic secondary compounds (polyphenolics) of nine leaf
   litter species. To differentiate between effects on exposure vs.
   susceptibility to infection, we included multiple infection experiments
   including one with constant per capita exposure.
   4. We found that increased litter nitrogen increased tadpole survival,
   and also increased cercaria production by the snail intermediate hosts,
   causing opposing effects on tadpole per capita exposure to trematode
   infection. Increased litter polyphenolics slowed tadpole development,
   leading to increased infection by increasing both their susceptibility
   to infection and the length of time they were exposed to parasites.
   5. Based on these results, recent shifts in forest composition towards
   more nitrogen-poor litter species should decrease trematode infection in
   tadpoles via density-and trait-mediated effects on the snail
   intermediate hosts. However, these shifts also involve increased
   abundance of litter species with high polyphenolic levels, which should
   increase trematode infection via trait-mediated effects on tadpoles.
   Future studies will be needed to determine the relative strength of
   these opposing effects in natural wetland communities. {[}Correction

Abstract = {{Since the 1940s, populations of Gray Vireos (Vireo vicinior) in
   California have collapsed, presumably because of parasitism by
   Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In 2012 and 2013, we studied the
   vireo's nesting ecology to assess factors affecting two of California's
   largest remaining populations in the chaparral of San Diego County. Nest
   success was extremely low, with a model-averaged probability of nest
   survival of only 0.08 (N=95). More nest failures were due to predation
   (83\%) than to cowbird parasitism (13\%). Video-recording at 30 nests
   revealed that California Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) were the
   most common nest predator (67\%). Of eight variables tested, height of
   shrubs surrounding the nest had the strongest negative influence on nest
   survival, but was more strongly correlated with cowbird parasitism than
   with jay predation. Despite frequent renesting, seasonal productivity
   was well below the level required to sustain a population, especially in
   northern San Diego County where we found no Gray Vireos at six of seven
   sites where they had been present from 1997 to 2001 and where cowbird
   parasitism was more frequent. The vireo's continuing range collapse
   contrasts with recent climate-change models predicting a range
   expansion, highlighting the importance of demographic studies. Low nest
   success is likely contributing to population declines in California, and
   the additive effect of cowbird parasitism suppresses productivity.
   Conservation of Gray Vireos in California will likely require
   development of alternative approaches to cowbird and scrub-jay control
   appropriate to sites widely scattered in rugged chaparral.}},

   closed, denser forest, with emergent trees. We hypothesized that
   infection incidence would be higher in open than in closed forest,

   that mistletoe parasitism would be higher on host species that were more
   abundant, taller, deciduous, and had less dense wood. We sampled 870

Abstract = {{The poultry industry is currently facing a serious problem of
   controlling coccidiosis, owing to the development of drug resistance
   against commonly available anticoccidials. Furthermore, an increasing
   demand in the consumers for drug residue free poultry and poultry
   products has led to the development of alternative strategies for the
   treatment and control of avian coccidiosis. In response to the invasion
   of Eimeria species in coccidiosis, oxidative stress is created by host
   cellular response which imparts pathology to the host tissue besides
   damaging the parasite. Hence, in order to alleviate the damage caused by
   oxidative stress during coccidiosis, the use of essential oils (EOs)
   rich in antioxidant compounds is being considered as an appealing
   approach. However, results are very divergent and often not as
   satisfactory as expected. Essential oils, as natural products, obtained
   from aromatic plants have the potential to serve as an alternate to
   anticoccidials. The present work aims to review the current state of
   knowledge, informative collection of results obtained over the years and
   to attain a critical decision in aspects of the use of EOs as
   anticoccidials.}},

Abstract = {{Threatened by devil facial tumour disease, the Tasmanian devil
   (Sarcophilus harrisii), a carnivorous marsupial confined to Tasmania,

   hosts to parasites to which they are immunologically naive. Given the
   importance of parasites to ecosystem function, it has been argued from a
   biodiversity perspective that parasites should be conserved in their own
   right. In this review we describe current knowledge, and limitations in
   our knowledge, of Tasmanian devil parasites. We then discuss the
   potential for changes in host-parasite interactions as a result of
   host-population decline and conservation management, both generally and
   with examples from the Tasmanian devil. The review closes with a

Volume = {{788}},

Abstract = {{The fish Perccottus glenii was introduced into Europe one hundred years
   ago from Eastern Asia, with several initial introduction points. We used
   parasitological analysis to verify homogeneity-of-origin of P. glenii
   populations in the middle part of a large river basin where this
   invasive fish was documented as having an aquarium-release origin. Among
   others, we detected populations of P. glenii with the host-specific
   cestode Nippotaenia mogurndae. This supports a non-aquarium introduction
   of the host due to the complex life cycle of the cestode, requiring an
   intermediate host that is unlikely in a captive environment.
   Nippotaenia-negative populations were recorded in the upper and middle
   Moscow River basin (supporting aquarium release), but
   Nippotaenia-positive populations were in its lower section, as well as
   in the Klyazma and Tsna River basins (indicating non-aquarium release).
   These three rivers are tributaries of the Oka. Thus, populations within
   the Oka River basin are derived from at least two separate introduction
   events from different sources. This investigation extends our knowledge
   regarding the number and geographic locations of initial introduction
   points for this rapidly spreading invasive species. It also highlights
   the importance of a comparative approach as a means to address seemingly
   intractable issues in invasion ecology.}},

   analysis}},
Journal = {{HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Toxocariasis is a highly prevalent parasitic disease in the
   tropical regions of the world, with its impact on public health being
   typically underestimated. To better recognise the trends and
   characteristics of toxocariasis research, this study is a bibliometric
   analysis of the global toxocariasis research.
   Methods: Searches were completed on April 5, 2016, using the Scopus
   database. A search without any language restriction was performed to
   extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Terms related to
   toxocariasis were used to perform a title keyword search.
   Results: A total of 2765 publications comprising 11 document types and
   published between 1932 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Articles
   were the most popular document form, accounting for 83.62\% of all
   publications, followed by letters (3.80\%) and reviews (3.4\%). The
   annual number of research publications increased from 30 in 1980 to 111
   in 2015, indicating that the number of publications on toxocariasis has
   increased slowly over the past 35 years. The United States of America
   and Japan are the predominant countries of origin, with 303 articles and
   207 articles, respectively, followed by Brazil and the United Kingdom,
   with 180 (6.5\%) each. The h-index for all the publications was 60. The
   highest h-index were for publications from the United Kingdom (h-index
   value = 43) and the United States (h index value = 39); these two
   countries were also involved with the highest number of international
   collaborations, with 27 and 28 countries, respectively.
   Conclusions: Developed countries, including the United States, Japan,
   the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, are the world's leaders
   in toxocariasis research, contributing to more than 34\% of the total
   published literature. In addition, developing countries, such as Brazil,
   Poland, Argentina and India, showed a noticeable increase in published
   papers on toxocariasis research in recent years. A push for more
   collaboration is needed to achieve a superior research strategy related
   to toxocariasis at the global level from the viewpoint of
   epidemiological data, clinical aspects, medical ecology, molecular
   aspects and treatment practices associated with toxocariasis.}},

   implications for intra-guild predation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Intra-guild predation (IGP) is an important phenomenon structuring
   ecological communities and affects the success of biological control.
   Here we show that parasitism by the koinobiont wasp Cotesia vestalis is
   associated with behavioural changes in its larval host (diamondback
   moth, Plutella xylostella) that reduce risk of IGP. Compared with
   unparasitised caterpillars, parasitised P. xylostella moved less
   frequently to new feeding patches on plants and were less likely to fall
   from the plant. Wolf spiders killed significantly fewer parasitised
   larvae. Reflecting their reduced movement and capacity to select plant
   tissue of optimal quality, parasitised caterpillars fed at a lower rate
   and exhibited delayed development suggesting a trade-off between IGP
   avoidance and nutrient intake by the host. This change in behaviour to
   reduce risk may cascade to the first trophic level and help explain the
   stability of IGP systems.}},

Title = {{Understanding trophic interactions in host-parasite associations using
   stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen can deliver
   insights into trophic interactions between organisms. While many studies
   on free-living organisms are available, the number of those focusing on
   trophic interactions between hosts and their associated parasites still
   remains scarce. In some cases information about taxa (e.g.
   acanthocephalans) is completely missing. Additionally, available data
   revealed different and occasionally contrasting patterns, depending on
   the parasite's taxonomic position and its degree of development, which
   is most probably determined by its feeding strategy (absorption of
   nutrients through the tegument versus active feeding) and its
   localization in the host.
   Methods: Using stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen we
   provided first data on the trophic position of an acanthocephalan
   species with respect to its fish host. Barbels (Barbus barbus) infected
   only with adult acanthocephalans Pomphorhynchus laevis as well as fish
   co-infected with the larval (L4) nematodes Eustrongylides sp. from host
   body cavity were investigated in order to determine the factors shaping
   host-parasite trophic interactions. Fish were collected in different
   seasons, to study also potential isotopic shifts over time, whereas
   barbels with single infection were obtained in summer and co-infected
   ones in autumn.
   Results: Acanthocephalans as absorptive feeders showed lower isotope
   discrimination values of delta N-15 than the fish host. Results obtained
   for the acanthocephalans were in line with other parasitic taxa (e.g.
   cestodes), which exhibit a similar feeding strategy. We assumed that
   they feed mainly on metabolites, which were reprocessed by the host and
   are therefore isotopically lighter. In contrast, the nematodes were
   enriched in the heavier isotope delta N-15 with respect to their host
   and the acanthocephalans, respectively. As active feeders they feed on
   tissues and blood in the body cavity of the host and thus showed isotope
   discrimination patterns resembling those of predators. We also observed
   seasonal differences in the isotope signatures of fish tissues and
   acanthocephalans, which were attributed to changes in food composition
   of the host and to seasonality in the transmission and development of
   acanthocephalans.
   Conclusions: This study provided first data on trophic interaction
   between an acanthocephalan species and its associated host, which
   support the tendency already described for other taxa with similar
   nutrition strategy (e.g. cestodes). Actively feeding taxa such as larval
   Eustrongylides sp., appear to act like predators as it can be seen from
   their isotope discrimination values. However, future research on
   additional host-parasite systems and especially on acanthocephalans is
   needed in order to corroborate these conclusions.}},

   specimens of shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus collected in the NE
   Atlantic. Six cestode species were found in the spiral valve of makos: 3
   are typical from lamnid sharks, namely, gravid specimens of
   Clistobothrium montaukensis, Gymnorhynchus isuri and Ceratobothrium
   xanthoceph alum, and 3 are immature specimens of cestode species common
   to several elasmobranchs, namely, Dinobothrium septaria, Nybelinia
   lingualis, and Phyllobothrium cf. lactuca. In addition, L3 larvae of
   Anisakis sp. type I were detected. Infracommunities were species poor
   and had low total helminth abundance. The result of Schluter's variance
   ratio test was compatible with the hypo thesis of independent
   colonization of helminth taxa. These results conform to previous studies
   on oceanic predators that have hypothesized that these hosts should have
   depauperate and unpredictable helminth infracommunities because oceanic
   conditions hamper parasite transmission. However, mean species richness
   and mean total abundance of cestodes of shortfin mako and other oceanic
   sharks did not significantly differ from those of elasmobranchs from
   other habitats. This suggests that the large body size and prey
   consumption rates of oceanic sharks offset the negative `dilution'
   effect of oceanic habitat on transmission rates. Additionally, or
   alternatively, parasites of oceanic sharks may have expanded the use of
   intermediate hosts through the trophic web to spread out the risk of
   failure to complete their life cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Studying host parasite interactions and their implications for evolution
   and ecology recently received increasing attention, particularly with
   regard to host physiology and immunity. Here we assess variation of
   urinary neopterin (uNEO), a marker of cellular immune activation and
   iummunosenescence, in response to age and anthelmintic treatment in
   semi-free ranging Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). Urinary NEO levels
   were measured via enzyme-immunoassay from 179 urine samples of 43
   individuals between 5-29 years of age. Efficiency of treatment was
   assessed by Mc Master flotation on repeated faecal samples, including 18
   untreated individuals as control group. We used linear mixed models with
   age and parasite status as main effects, controlling for sex and
   physical condition, assessed through urinary C-Peptide-levels, with
   social group and ID as random factors. Urinary NEO levels significantly
   increased with age, suggesting that changes in aging Barbary macaque
   immune responses are consistent with immunosenescence described in human
   and nonhuman primates and can be detected via uNEO measurements.
   Anthelmintic treatment, however, had no influence on uNEO levels,
   potentially due to quick reinfections or attenuated immune responses in
   repeated infections. We conclude that uNEO is a potential non-invasive
   marker for immune function and particularly immunosenescence in
   wildlife.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Abstract = {{To assess whether closely related host species harbour similar symbiotic
   communities, we studied two polychaetes, Chaetopterus sp. (n = 11) and
   Chaetopterus cf. appendiculatus (n = 83) living in soft sediments of
   Nhatrang Bay (South China Sea, Vietnam). The former harboured the
   porcellanid crabs Polyonyx cf. heok and Polyonyx sp., the pinnotherid
   crab Tetrias sp. and the tergipedid nudibranch Phestilla sp. The latter
   harboured the polynoid polychaete Ophthalmonoe pettiboneae, the carapid
   fish Onuxodon fowleri and the porcellanid crab Eulenaios cometes, all of
   which, except O. fowleri, seemed to be specialized symbionts. The
   species richness and mean intensity of the symbionts were higher in
   Chaetopterus sp. than in C. cf. appendiculatus (1.8 and 1.02 species and
   3.0 and 1.05 individuals per host respectively). We suggest that the
   lower density of Chaetopterus sp. may explain the higher number of
   associated symbionts observed, as well as the 100\% prevalence (69.5\%
   in C. cf. appenciculatus). Most Chaetopterus sp. harboured two symbiotic
   species, which was extremely rare in C. cf. appendiculatus, suggesting
   lower interspecific interactions in the former. The crab and nudibranch
   symbionts of Chaetopterus sp. often shared a host and lived in pairs,
   thus partitioning resources. This led to the species coexisting in the
   tubes of Chaetopterus sp., establishing a tightly packed community,
   indicating high species richness and mean intensity, together with a low
   species dominance. In contrast, the aggressive, strictly territorial
   species associated with C. cf. appendiculatus established a symbiotic
   community strongly dominated by single species and, thus, low species
   richness and mean intensity. Therefore, we suggest that interspecific
   interactions are determining species richness, intensity and dominance,
   while intraspecific interactions are influencing only intensity and
   abundance. It is possible that species composition may have influenced
   the differences in community structure observed. We hypothesize that
   both host species could originally be allopatric. The evolutionary
   specialization of the symbiotic communities would occur in separated
   geographical areas, while the posterior disappearance of the existing
   geographical barriers would lead to the overlapped distribution.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{E42-E48}},

Abstract = {{Profound changes are occurring in the epidemiology of schistosomiasis, a
   neglected tropical disease caused by a chronic infection with parasitic
   helminths of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosomiasis currently affects
   240 million people worldwide, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The advent
   and proliferation of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes using the
   drug praziquantel is resulting in substantial increases in the number of
   people, mainly children aged 6-14 years, being effectively treated,
   approaching the point where most people in endemic areas will receive
   one or more treatments during their lifetimes. Praziquantel treatment
   not only cures infection but also frees the host from the powerful
   immunomodulatory action of the parasites. The treatment simultaneously
   enhances exposure to key parasite antigens, accelerating the development
   of protective acquired immunity, which would take many years to develop
   naturally. At a population level, these changes constitute a substantial
   alteration to schistosome ecology in that the parasites are more likely
   to be exposed not only to praziquantel directly but also to hosts with
   altered immune phenotypes. Here, we consider the consequences of this
   for schistosome biology, immunoepidemiology, and public health. We
   anticipate that there could be substantial effects on chronic pathology,
   natural immunity, vaccine development strategies, immune disorders, and
   drug efficacy. This makes for a complex picture that will only become
   apparent over decades. We recommend careful monitoring and assessment to
   accompany the roll-out of MDA programmes to ensure that the considerable
   health benefits to populations are achieved and sustained.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability
   to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to
   analyse them. These diverse, complex and often highdimensional data sets
   exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple
   variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical
   statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides
   methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting
   knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal
   behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of
   these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start
   by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal
   behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML
   framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and
   supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key
   ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three
   different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and
   ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of
   spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance
   of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative
   clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits
   from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus
   monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the
   construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to
   train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes
   taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of
   cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of
   data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will
   play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge
   and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical
   toolkit. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is the most widespread bacteria in
   insects, yet the ecology of novel acquisitions in natural host
   populations is poorly understood. Using temporal data separated by 12
   years, I tested the hypothesis that immigration of a parasitoid wasp led
   to transmission of its Wolbachia strain to its dipteran host, resulting
   in double-strain infection, and I used geographic and community surveys
   to explore the history of transmission in fly and parasitoid. Double
   infection in the fly host was present before immigration of the
   parasitoid. Equal prevalence of double infection in males and females,
   constant prevalence before and after immigration in two regions, and
   increase in one region of immigration indicate little if no competition
   between strains. Double infection was present throughout the fly's
   distribution range, but proportions varied highly (0-0.71, mean = 0.26).
   Two fly-specific MLST strains, observed in Eastern and Western Europe,
   respectively, differed at hcpA only. Flies with either fly-strain could
   be double infected with the parasitoid's strain. The geographic
   distribution of double infection implies that it is older than the fly
   host's extent distribution range and that different proportions of
   double infection are caused by demographic fluctuations in the fly. The
   geographic data in combination with community surveys of infections and
   strains further suggest that the parasitoid strain was the fly's
   ancestral strain that was transmitted to the parasitoid, that is, the
   reverse transmission route as first hypothesized. Based on these
   findings together with a comparison of oviposition strategies of other
   hosts harboring related Wolbachia strains, I hypothesize that

Abstract = {{The periwinkle, Littorina sitkana, is found throughout the intertidal
   zone, often in isolated subpopulations. The majority of trematode
   parasites use snails as intermediate hosts, and decreased survivorship
   is often observed in snails infected with trematodes. Sampling L.sitkana
   from four sites in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, we test the
   effects of parasitic infection on snail survival using maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian approaches using the software MARK and WinBUGS.
   We found that survival of periwinkles and trematode community
   composition differed among sites, but survival and trematode prevalence
   were uncorrelated. WinBUGS performed better than MARK in two ways: (1)
   by allowing the use of information on known mortality, thus preventing
   survival overestimation; and (2) by giving more stable estimates while
   testing the effect of body size on snail survival. Our results suggest
   that snail survival depends heavily on local environmental factors that
   may vary greatly within a small geographical region. These findings are
   important because the majority of experimental studies on survival are
   done on snails from a single location.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific genetic variation in arthropods is often studied in the
   context of evolution and ecology. Such knowledge, however, can also be
   very usefully applied to biological pest control. Selection of genotypes
   with optimal trait values may be a powerful tool to develop more
   effective biocontrol agents. Although it has repeatedly been proposed,
   this approach is still hardly applied in the current commercial
   development of arthropod agents for pest control. In this perspective
   study, we call to take advantage of the increasing knowledge on the
   genetics underlying intraspecific variation to improve biological
   control agents. We argue that it is timely now because at present both
   the need and the technical possibilities for implementation exist, as
   there is (1) increased economic importance of biocontrol, (2) reduced
   availability of exotic biocontrol agents due to stricter legislation,
   and (3) increased availability of genetic information on non-model
   species. We present a step-by-step approach towards the exploitation of
   intraspecific genetic variation for biocontrol, outline that knowledge
   of the underlying genetic mechanisms is essential for success, and
   indicate how new molecular techniques can facilitate this. Finally, we
   exemplify this procedure by two case studies, one focussing on a target
   trait - offspring sex ratio - across species of hymenopteran
   parasitoids, and the other on a target species - the two-spot ladybird
   beetle - where wing length and body colouration can be optimized for
   aphid control. With this overview, we aim to inspire scientific
   researchers and biocontrol agent producers to start collaborating on the
   use of genetic variation for the improvement of natural enemies.}},

Pages = {{31-40}},

Abstract = {{We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association
   between immunity and personality. The risk of-parasitism hypothesis
   predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking)
   individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk
   of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues
   that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans
   and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations
   between immunity and personality can arise because personality
   differences are often associated with differences in condition and
   stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with
   immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality
   (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three
   indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of
   defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected),
   chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating
   corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a
   subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of
   natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast
   explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of
   exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This
   suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness
   did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style
   did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these
   results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune
   function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Infected organisms can resist or tolerate infection, with tolerance of
   infection defined as minimizing per-parasite reductions in fitness.
   Although tolerance is well studied in plants, researchers have only
   begun to probe the mechanisms and transmission consequences of tolerance
   in animals. Here we suggest that research on tolerance in animals would
   benefit from explicitly incorporating behavior as a component of
   tolerance, given the importance of behavior for host fitness and
   parasite transmission. We propose two distinct manifestations of
   tolerance in animals: tissue-specific tolerance, which minimizes fitness
   losses due to tissue damage during infection, and behavioral tolerance,
   which minimizes fitness losses by maintaining normal, fitness-enhancing
   behaviors during infection. Here we briefly review one set of potential
   immune mechanisms underlying both responses in vertebrate animals:
   inflammation and its associated signaling molecules. Inflammatory
   responses, including broadly effective resistance mechanisms like the
   production of reactive oxygen species, can incur severe costs in terms
   of damage to a host's own tissues, thereby reducing tissue-specific
   tolerance. In addition, signaling molecules involved in these responses
   facilitate stereotypical behavioral changes during infection, which
   include lethargy and anorexia, reducing normal behaviors and behavioral
   tolerance. We consider how tissue-specific and behavioral tolerance may
   vary independently or in conjunction and outline potential consequences
   of such covariation for the transmission of infectious diseases. We put
   forward the distinction between tissue-specific and behavioral tolerance
   not as a definitive framework, but to help stimulate and broaden future
   research by considering animal behavior as intimately linked to the
   mechanisms and consequences of tolerance in animals. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Conservation biological control aims to enhance natural enemy

   basilicum) on the fecundity and olfactory attractiveness of the egg
   parasitoid Trissolcus basalis, an important biological control agent of

   buckwheat and basil flowers increased the parasitoid offspring. However,
   in olfactometer experiments where T. basalis was allowed to choose
   between flowering and non-flowering plants, only buckwheat floral scent
   was attractive. Headspace analyses of the odour emitted by the four
   plant species revealed very distinct profiles with little overlap in
   compounds. Buckwheat floral scent was characterized by an unpleasant
   smell for the human nose due to the presence of short-chain carboxylic

Abstract = {{The sequential sampling of populations with unequal probabilities and

   communication. Many of these questions can be reformulated as urn
   problems, often as special cases of the coupon collector problem, most
   simply expressed as the number of coupons that must be collected to have
   a complete set. We aimed to apply the coupon collector model in a
   comprehensive manner to one example-hosts (balls) being searched (draws)
   and parasitized (ball colour change) by parasitic wasps-to evaluate the
   influence of differences in sampling probabilities between items on
   collection speed. Based on the model of a complete multinomial process
   over time, we define the distribution, distribution function,
   expectation and variance of the number of hosts parasitized after a

   effort. We develop the relationship between the risk distribution on the

   proof of theweak stochastic dominance among speeds of parasitization,
   using the concept of Schur convexity and the `Robin Hood transfer'
   numerical operation. Numerical examples are provided and a conjecture
   about strong dominance-an ordering characteristic of random variables-is

   be free-living or parasitic; (ii) whether to reproduce asexually or
   sexually; and (iii) whether to be gonochoristic (separate-sexed) or
   hermaphroditic. I then examine two further decisions involving
   hermaphroditism: (iv) outcrossing versus selfing and (v) the balance of
   investment into the male versus the female sex function (sex
   allocation). Collectively, these lifestyle choices set the basic rules
   for how reproduction occurs, but as I emphasize in the second part of

   impacted by the near-pervasive and powerful pressure of sexual
   selection, together with the related phenomena of sperm competition and
   sexual conflict. Exactly how this plays out, however, is strongly

   This suggests that it is possible to predict the permissive host set for

Abstract = {{Root hemiparasitic plants take up resources from the roots of
   neighbouring plants, which they use for fuelling their own growth. While
   taking up resources from the hosts below-ground, they may simultaneously
   compete with the hosts for sunlight. Suppression caused by the
   parasitism could result in openings in the vegetation structure and
   increased mortality levels. On the other hand, the root hemiparasites
   may also be constrained by the hosts, restricting the parasites to a
   limited number of locations within a community. These vegetation
   alterations and location restrictions can be referred to as spatial
   signatures of the root hemiparasites. In order to search for such
   spatial signatures, we investigated a population of a predominant Acacia
   species in Australia co-occurring with established root hemiparasitic
   shrubs, using intensity estimates of the Acacia and dead shrubs to be
   indicators of parasite populations. We find evidence that the root
   hemiparasitic shrubs, like herbaceous root hemiparasites, prefer growing
   at distances from neighbouring plants that fulfil resource requirements
   both below-ground and above-ground. Assuming that root hemiparasites are
   limited by their hosts, we present an optimal host density and distance
   to host hypothesis (`Goldilocks hypothesis') to account for such a

   intraspecific competition and shoot parasitism, the root parasitism
   could explain some of the mortality in open areas. It is likely that

Abstract = {{The study of island biodiversity has inspired many advances in
   evolutionary biology. However, whether patterns of microorganism
   diversity are influenced by insularity is poorly understood. In
   particular, microorganisms that live in symbiotic association, such as
   the microbiota that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of bigger
   animals, are subjected to demographic and coevolutionary processes that
   may add complexity to the common expectation of impoverished diversity
   on oceanic islands. Here, we explore this topic by studying the
   cultivable gut bacteria of two sister species of birds, from Sao Tome
   island and nearby mainland Gabon, the endemic Sao Tome thrush Turdus
   olivaceofuscus and the African thrush Turdus pelios. We found no
   differences in the diversity of cultivable gut bacteria between these

   insularity might not represent a strong constraint for gut bacterial
   diversity. Although further research on complete gut bacterial
   communities and a broader range of species and areas is needed, our
   initial results suggest that the cultivable gut microbial community may
   bypass the diversity loss associated with island colonization. This
   could arise from intrinsic factors such as their large population sizes
   within hosts and low rates of extinction. Furthermore, as gut
   communities are composed mainly by mutualistic bacteria, diversifying
   selection (against an impoverished bacterial community), may counteract
   the diversity loss brought about by the stochastic and demographic

Abstract = {{Parasites typically have broader thermal limits than hosts, so large
   performance gaps between pathogens and their cold-and warm-adapted hosts
   should occur at relatively warm and cold temperatures, respectively. We
   tested this thermal mismatch hypothesis by quantifying the
   temperature-dependent susceptibility of cold-and warm-adapted amphibian
   species to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using
   laboratory experiments and field prevalence estimates from 15 410
   individuals in 598 populations. In both the laboratory and field, we
   found that the greatest susceptibility of cold-and warm-adapted hosts
   occurred at relatively warm and cool temperatures, respectively,
   providing support for the thermal mismatch hypothesis. Our results
   suggest that as climate change shifts hosts away from their optimal
   temperatures, the probability of increased host susceptibility to
   infectious disease might increase, but the effect will depend on the
   host species and the direction of the climate shift. Our findings help
   explain the tremendous variation in species responses to Bd across
   climates and spatial, temporal and species-level variation in disease
   outbreaks associated with extreme weather events that are becoming more
   common with climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Several parameters should be addressed before incriminating a vector for
   Leishmania transmission. Those may include its ability to become
   infected by the same Leishmania species found in humans, the degree of
   attractiveness for reservoirs and humans and capacity to sustain
   parasite infection under laboratory conditions. This study evaluated the
   vectorial capacity of Lutzomyia cruzi for Leishmania infantum and
   gathered information on its ability to harbor L. amazonensis.
   Laboratory-reared Lu. cruzi were infected experimentally by feeding them
   on dogs infected naturally with L. infantum and hamsters infected with
   L. amazonensis. Sand fly attractiveness to dogs and humans was
   determined using wild caught insects. The expected daily survival of
   infected Lu. cruzi, the duration of the gonotrophic cycle, and the
   extrinsic incubation period were also investigated for both parasites.
   Vector competence was investigated for both Leishmania species. The mean
   proportion of female sand flies that fed on hosts was 0.40. For L.
   infantum and L. amazonensis, Lu. cruzi had experimental infection rates
   of 10.55\% and 41.56\%, respectively. The extrinsic incubation period
   was 3 days for both Leishmania species, regardless of the host. Survival
   expectancy of females infected with L. infantum and L. amazonensis after
   completing the gonotrophic cycle was 1.32 and 0.43, respectively. There
   was no association between L. infantum infection and sand fly longevity,
   but L. amazonensis-infected flies had significantly greater survival
   probabilities. Furthermore, egg-laying was significantly detrimental to
   survival. Lu. cruzi was found to be highly attracted to both dogs and
   humans. After a bloodmeal on experimentally infected hosts, both
   parasites were able to survive and develop late-stage infections in Lu.
   cruzi. However, transmission was demonstrated only for L.
   amazonensis-infected sand flies. In conclusion, Lu. cruzi fulfilled
   several of the requirements of vectorial capacity for L. infantum
   transmission. Moreover, it was also permissive to L. amazonensis.}},

   density, low precipitation and low orthophosphate concentrations.
   Parasite load - the number of sporangia per infected diatom cell, also
   referred to as the mean intensity of infection, I-increased with
   infection prevalence, but the population average never exceed two
   parasites per host. Net growth rates of chytrid populations exceeded
   those of A. formosa host diatoms in the spring under low-flow

Abstract = {{Despite being a ``top predator{''}/parasite in the Great Lakes,

   ecology. Of particular interest is the use of fatty acid profiles to
   qualitatively describe foraging patterns of sea lamprey. Adult sea
   lamprey were captured throughout the Lake Michigan basin during spring
   spawning migrations into rivers, and muscle tissues were analyzed for
   fatty acid profiles. Exploratory multivariate analyses were used to
   investigate variation in fatty acid profiles among captured individuals
   and to compare these to profiles of potential host species. In general,
   we noted a large variability in fatty acid profiles suggesting a broad

Abstract = {{Ecological communities are increasingly exposed to natural and
   anthropogenic stressors. While the effects of individual stressors have
   been broadly investigated, there is growing evidence that multiple
   stressors are frequently encountered underscoring the need to examine
   interactive effects. Pesticides and infectious diseases are two common
   stressors that regularly occur together in nature. Given the documented
   lethal and sublethal effects of each stressor on individuals, there is
   the potential for interactive effects that alter disease outcomes and
   pesticide toxicity. Using larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), we
   examined the reciprocal interaction between insecticides (carbaryl and
   thiamethoxam) and the viral pathogen ranavirus by testing whether: (1)
   prior ranavirus infection influences pesticide toxicity and (2)
   sublethal pesticide exposure increases susceptibility to and
   transmission of ranavirus. We found that prior infection with ranavirus
   increased pesticide toxicity.; median lethal concentration (LC50)
   estimates were reduced by 72 and 55\% for carbaryl and thiamethoxam,
   respectively. Importantly, LC50 estimates were reduced to concentrations
   found in natural systems. This is the first demonstration that an
   infection can alter pesticide toxicity. We also found that prior
   pesticide exposure exacerbated disease-induced mortality by increasing
   mortality rates, but effects on infection prevalence and transmission of
   the pathogen were minimal. Collectively, our results underscore the
   importance of incorporating complexity (i.e. order and timing of
   exposures) into research examining the interactions between natural and
   anthropogenic stressors. Given the environmental heterogeneity present
   in nature, such research will provide a more comprehensive understanding
   of how stressors affect wildlife. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   To date, woodland Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) studies have focused
   entirely on northern hemisphere managed plantations. We manipulated
   atmospheric CO2 in a mature, native Eucalyptus woodland (0.15 ha, > 32
   000 m(3)) in Australia, using the Eucalyptus FACE ('EucFACE') facility.
   We used three complementary sampling methods (vacuum sampling, pitfall
   and sticky trapping) to record invertebrate abundances under ambient and
   elevated levels of CO2 (400 versus 550 ppm).
   Based on the collection of over 83 000 invertebrates, we found
   significant declines in the overall abundance of ground-dwelling
   (14.7\%) and aerial (12.9\%) arthropods under elevated CO2, with
   significant decreases in herbivore, omnivore, scavenger and parasitoid
   functional groups. Even though several groups showed varying declines in
   abundance, elevated CO2 did not measurably affect community composition.
   The results of the present study indicate that atmospheric CO2 levels
   predicted within the next 35 years may cause declines in arthropod
   abundances in Eucalyptus woodland. Declines found in several functional
   groups suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 has the potential to affect
   ecosystem processes, possibly including nutrient cycling by herbivores

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{410-430}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Parasites are common in many ecosystems, yet because of their nature,
   they do not fossilise readily and are very rare in the geological
   record. This makes it challenging to study the evolutionary transition
   that led to the evolution of parasitism in different taxa. Most studies
   on the evolution of parasites are based on phylogenies of extant species
   that were constructed based on morphological and molecular data, but
   they give us an incomplete picture and offer little information on many
   important details of parasite-host interactions. The lack of fossil
   parasites also means we know very little about the roles that parasites
   played in ecosystems of the past even though it is known that parasites
   have significant influences on many ecosystems. The goal of this review
   is to bring attention to known fossils of parasites and parasitism, and
   provide a conceptual framework for how research on fossil parasites can
   develop in the future. Despite their rarity, there are some fossil
   parasites which have been described from different geological eras.
   These fossils include the free-living stage of parasites, parasites
   which became fossilised with their hosts, parasite eggs and propagules
   in coprolites, and traces of pathology inflicted by parasites on the
   host's body. Judging from the fossil record, while there were some
   parasite-host relationships which no longer exist in the present day,
   many parasite taxa which are known from the fossil record seem to have
   remained relatively unchanged in their general morphology and their
   patterns of host association over tens or even hundreds of millions of
   years. It also appears that major evolutionary and ecological
   transitions throughout the history of life on Earth coincided with the
   appearance of certain parasite taxa, as the appearance of new host
   groups also provided new niches for potential parasites. As such, fossil
   parasites can provide additional data regarding the ecology of their
   extinct hosts, since many parasites have specific life cycles and
   transmission modes which reflect certain aspects of the host's ecology.
   The study of fossil parasites can be conducted using existing techniques
   in palaeontology and palaeoecology, and microscopic examination of
   potential material such as coprolites may uncover more fossil evidence
   of parasitism. However, I also urge caution when interpreting fossils as
   examples of parasites or parasitism-induced traces. I point out a number
   of cases where parasitism has been spuriously attributed to some fossil
   specimens which, upon re-examination, display traits which are just as
   (if not more) likely to be found in free-living taxa. The study of
   parasite fossils can provide a more complete picture of the ecosystems
   and evolution of life throughout Earth's history.}},

Abstract = {{Tree mortality and forest decline have been attributed to the several
   factors including mistletoe infection in Oak Zagros forest, western
   Iran. As a result of climate change and fragmentation Loranthus
   europaeus has the potential to be more abundant and distributed in these
   forests. However, little attention has been given to the need for an
   ecosystem approach to their management. To manage it, scientific
   understanding of its ecology including recognition of mistletoe spatial
   pattern and its shaping mechanisms are essential. Using spatial
   analysis, we examined the spatial distribution pattern of mistletoes in
   terms of life stages and vertical and horizontal host crown
   classification in relation to its controlling mechanisms, including host
   and habitat features. The results showed that twenty-three percent of
   the trees were infected, infected trees having an average of 4.08
   mistletoes. Mistletoes were higher in the middle, lower and inner
   portion of the infected trees crown, corroborating that mistletoes were
   aggregated in these parts of the crown. The small scale pattern (451 in)
   of adult mistletoe distribution was observed, whereas juvenile and
   medium-aged mistletoes were spread at larger distances of 5110 and 4537
   m. Mistletoe prevalence spatially autocorrelated up to about 2 km while
   plot intensity distributed at small range of 316 m. The results suggest
   that mistletoes first establish in the middle crown part then develop
   downward into lower crown. The spatial patterns of plot intensity, adult
   and lower crown mistletoes with smaller ranges were spatially correlated

Abstract = {{Organic farming system and sustainable management of soil pathogens aim
   at reducing the use of agricultural chemicals in order to improve
   ecosystem health. Despite the essential role of microbial communities in
   agro-ecosystems, we still have limited understanding of the complex
   response of microbial diversity and composition to organic and
   conventional farming systems and to alternative methods for controlling
   plant pathogens. In this study we assessed the microbial community
   structure, diversity and richness using 16S rRNA gene next generation
   sequences and report that conventional and organic farming systems had
   major influence on soil microbial diversity and community composition
   while the effects of the soil health treatments (sustainable
   alternatives for chemical control) in both farming systems were of
   smaller magnitude. Organically managed system increased taxonomic and
   phylogenetic richness, diversity and heterogeneity of the soil
   microbiota when compared with conventional farming system. The
   composition of microbial communities, but not the diversity nor
   heterogeneity, were altered by soil health treatments. Soil health
   treatments exhibited an overrepresentation of specific microbial taxa
   which are known to be involved in soil suppressiveness to pathogens
   (plant-parasitic nematodes and soil borne fungi). Our results provide a

   Perch Perca fluviatilis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Stable isotope analysis of commercially and ecologically important fish
   can improve understanding of life-history and trophic ecology. However,
   accurate interpretation of stable isotope values requires knowledge of
   tissue-specific isotopic turnover that will help to describe differences
   in the isotopic composition of tissues and diet. We performed a
   diet-switch experiment using captive-reared parasite-free Eurasian perch
   (Perca fluviatilis) and wild caught specimens of the same species,
   infected with the pike tapeworm Triaenophorus nodulosus living in host
   liver tissue. We hypothesize that metabolic processes related to
   infection status play a major role in isotopic turnover and examined the
   influence of parasite infection on isotopic turn-over rate of carbon
   (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15) and sulphur (delta S-34) in liver,
   blood and muscle. The delta N-15 and delta C-13 turnovers were fastest
   in liver tissues, followed by blood and muscle. In infected fish, liver
   and blood delta N-15 and delta C-13 turnover rates were similar.
   However, in infected fish, liver and blood delta C-13 turnover was
   faster than that of delta N-15. Moreover, in infected subjects, liver
   delta N-15 and delta C-13 turnover rates were three to five times faster
   than in livers of uninfected subjects (isotopic half-life of ca.3-4 days
   compared to 16 and 10 days, respectively). Blood delta S-34 turnover
   rate were about twice faster in non-infected individuals implying that
   parasite infection could retard the turnover rate of delta S-34 and
   sulphur containing amino acids. Slower turnover rate of essential amino
   acid could probably decrease individual immune function. These indicate
   potential hidden costs of chronic and persistent infections that may
   have accumulated adverse effects and might eventually impair
   life-history fitness. For the first time, we were able to shift the
   isotope values of parasites encapsulated in the liver by changing the
   dietary source of the host. We also report variability in isotopic
   turnover rates between tissues, elements and between infected and
   parasite-free individuals. These results contribute to our understanding
   of data obtained from field and commercial hatcheries; and strongly
   improve the applicability of the stable isotope method in understanding
   life-history and trophic ecology of fish populations.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of individuals of any species is a basic
   concern of ecology. The spatial distribution of parasites matters to
   control and conservation of parasites that affect human and nonhuman
   populations. This paper develops a quantitative theory to predict the
   spatial distribution of parasites based on the distribution of parasites
   in hosts and the spatial distribution of hosts. Four models are tested
   against observations of metazoan hosts and their parasites in littoral
   zones of four lakes in Otago, New Zealand. These models differ in two
   dichotomous assumptions, constituting a 2 x 2 theoretical design. One
   assumption specifies whether the variance function of the number of
   parasites per host individual is described by Taylor's law (TL) or the
   negative binomial distribution (NBD). The other assumption specifies
   whether the numbers of parasite individuals within each host in a square
   meter of habitat are independent or perfectly correlated among host
   individuals. We find empirically that the variance-mean relationship of
   the numbers of parasites per square meter is verywell described by TL
   but is not well described by NBD. Two models that posit perfect
   correlation of the parasite loads of hosts in a square meter of habitat
   approximate observations much better than two models that posit
   independence of parasite loads of hosts in a square meter, regardless of
   whether the variance-mean relationship of parasites per host individual
   obeys TL or NBD. We infer that high local interhost correlations in
   parasite load strongly influence the spatial distribution of parasites.
   Local hotspots could influence control and conservation of parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Jenynsia multidentata Jenyns, 1842 (one-sided livebearers) are
   euryhaline viviparous fish of small size, used in the laboratory
   experiment, important as resource for biological control of mosquito's
   larva and a key species to recover eutrophic lakes. Works have been
   published dealing with parasite biodiversity of this host, but little
   has been studied about the parasite community ecology. From early 2009
   to ends of 2010 specimens of J. multidentata were collected from two
   places, the Salado Relief Channel (S.R.C.) on Samborombon Bay and the
   Sauce Chico River near to the city of Bahia Blanca (B.B.). All fish were
   sexed, measured and grouped into sizes/age classes. The fishes from both
   sites harbored 16 parasitic species: nine digenean, one monogenean, one
   metacestode, one acanthocephalan, two nematode and two copepods.
   Lecithaster confusus Odhner, 1905, the metacercariae Hemiuridae gen. sp.

   sp. nematode L4 (intestine) and Ergasilus sieboldii Nordmann, 1832 are

   fish a link between micro and macroecosystems. The size 2 had the higher
   biodiversity in both sites, which could be the most suitable age to
   store the maximal number of parasite of the environment and have a more
   equitability in their distribution on the host. In B.B. some parasites
   had higher prevalence and mean abun dance due to the small size of the
   waterbody compared with the S.R.C. Despite that, in S.R.C. exist a
   higher specific richness and biodiversity due the daily flow of saline
   and freshwater and proximity of the sample site to the mouth of the
   channel in the bay. This is the first approximation to an analysis of
   the parasitic ecology on this host.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{114-129}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the early stages of the coevolutionary
   interactions between brood parasites and their hosts or how rapidly
   hosts evolve defences. We investigated the success of breeding attempts
   by the brood-parasitic Pacific Koel (Eudynamys orientalis) and its
   newest host, the Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), at two sites
   where wattlebirds have been exposed to different durations of
   parasitism: Sydney (38-86 years) and Canberra (8-33 years). Parasitism
   was more frequent in Sydney and nest predation increased in Sydney after
   the arrival of migratory koels, yet the nest success rate of wattlebirds
   was not significantly lower than in Canberra. Wattlebirds rarely reject
   foreign eggs, but their low clutch size, earlier breeding and
   abandonment of koel eggs laid before the host's laying period might
   explain the low impact of koels. Parasitised nests fledged wattlebird
   and koel young at equal rates, but fledged fewer wattlebird young than
   unparasitised nests. The koel's later breeding and poor timing of egg
   laying may have contributed to the low success of koel eggs. These
   results suggest that host switching may have a negative impact on the
   reproductive success of both the parasite and the new host, and naive
   hosts may avoid parasitism using generalised defences that require no
   egg or parasite recognition.}},

Title = {{Food preferences of enchytraeids}},
Journal = {{PEDOBIOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{19-36}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this review is to evaluate the food sources for enchytraeids
   and to contribute to the current knowledge of their feeding preferences.
   Several food sources have been described in detail: (1) plant material,
   (2) macroalgae, (3) animal remains, (4) feces of invertebrates, (5)
   bacteria, (6) fungi, (7) microalgae, (8) nematodes, and (9) locust eggs.
   The present article considers selective ingestion, digestion, and
   factors affecting enchytraeid food selection. We also provide basic
   information on enzymatic activity, particularly cellulolytic capability.
   Recent findings on Cognettia sphagnetorum, which have shown that several
   cryptic species were hidden under this single species name, shed new
   light on the somewhat inconsistent data presented in the literature over
   a long time. Apart from that, the recurrent issue of enchytraeids as
   plant pests is re-discussed here. This unsupported assumption is still
   the subject of general agricultural textbooks and requires further
   clarification. Contrary to old hypotheses, potworms are not plant
   parasites, and they have little or no cellulolytic capability.
   Enchytraeids can be divided into two groups: (1) primary decomposers and
   (2) secondary decomposers/sapro-microphytophages. There is also some
   evidence, albeit weak, that some species prey on nematodes. So far, the
   trophic preferences of only a few enchytraeid species have been studied
   in detail, but it is evident that several feeding strategies exist
   within the family. These studies include direct observation of feeding
   behavior, gut content analyses, enzymatic analyses, cultivation on
   different nutrient sources, choice tests, various types of soil
   microcosms, litter bags, and isotopic techniques. Molecular methods have
   been used only occasionally, although they could largely support further
   necessary research on potworm feeding ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Leucospis Fabricius is comprised of parasitoid wasps
   relatively uncommon in nature. Their immature stages develop on aculeate
   Hymenoptera, in particular solitary bees, but hosts are known for only
   around 25 Leucospis species (about 20\% of 115-120 world species), so
   the true relationship of this family with bees is largely unknown. Here
   we report on individuals of five species of Leucospis wasps which
   emerged from nests of different bee and wasp species during distinct
   sampling periods during a trap-nesting programme, in two contrasting
   areas: agro-ecosystems and natural habitats in the Pampean region. Some
   of these nests were parasitised by L. cayennensis Westwood, L. coxalis
   Kirby, L. egaia Walker, L. pulchriceps Cameron and L. signifera Boucek.
   Our results expand the available information of host species for L.
   cayennensis, L. coxalis, L. egaia and L. pulchriceps and represent the
   first record of hosts associated with L. signifera. The hosts were only
   bee species of the genera Centris, Tetrapedia (family Apidae) and
   Megachile (Megachilidae). These species were more abundant in the
   natural reserve than in agro-ecosystems, suggesting that anthropogenic
   activities could negatively affect their populations. Most nests were
   attacked in one (43.7\%) or two (40.7\%) cells, but the remaining nests
   (16.5\%) had more (up to seven cells). However, the position of the
   attacked cells was variable, suggesting that females of Leucospis
   species oviposit in recently built cells, and that the hatching of
   larvae is delayed, or that the first larval stage waits until the host
   larva reaches a sufficient size to attack.}},

Abstract = {{Plants and herbivores both release volatile organic compounds that have
   important roles in mediating important biological functions related to
   defence and reproduction. Plants emit complex blends of chemicals that
   are involved in multitrophic interactions, coordination of systemic
   defence responses and pollination, whereas herbivorous insects release
   pheromones that play important roles in attracting mates, instigating
   defence responses and initiating aggregation. Interactions between
   plants and herbivores have been subject to a wealth of studies and
   knowledge on their biology, biochemistry, ecology and evolution is
   constantly expanding. In this chapter the idea of communication between
   plants and herbivores will be explored. Communication between organisms
   of consecutive trophic levels is somewhat controversial due to
   unidirectional reliance and competition precluding some of the
   requirements of a conventional communication process, but there are
   growing examples of where chemically mediated interactions between
   plants and herbivores can be viewed as eavesdropping by a signal
   recipient, or even as true communication where both chemical emitter and
   receiver gain a benefit from communication. Examples of herbivores
   responding to plant-emitted cues and plants responding to
   herbivore-emitted cues are both explored, and suggestions for future

Abstract = {{This study compared the structure of metazoan parasite communities in
   two populations of Leporinus friderici from two rivers of the Amazon
   River system in Brazil. Jainus leporini, Urocleidoides paradoxus,
   Urocleidoides sp., Tereancistrum parvus, Tereancistrum sp., Clinostomum
   marginatum, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, Contracaecum
   sp., Octospiniferoides incognita and Ergasilus sp. were found in both
   hosts. There were differences in species richness of parasites, Shannon
   index and the evenness between both host populations, because the
   parasite community showed a similarity of only 33\%. Parasites of both
   host populations had an aggregated dispersion. Host size also
   contributes to the differences between the populations of hosts
   investigated, and the feeding habit contributes to the occurrence of
   endoparasites in L. friderici, an intermediate host for these parasites.
   The existence of variation in infracommunity and community of parasites
   for the same host species from different localities indicates the
   presence of an uneven distribution in terms of species and density of
   parasites, which are intermediate hosts, and some of them constitute
   food items for L. friderici in the localities surveyed.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of herbivorous insects are naturally consumed by other
   predacious or predatory insect species. These entomophagous insects are
   thus plant-dwelling organisms that use the plant for several vital
   functions and are affected by plant traits at the evolutionary, organism
   and population levels. Many entomophagous species are used for the
   biological control of insect pests worldwide. The aim of this chapter is
   to provide an exhaustive review of mechanisms underlying the
   interactions between plants and entomophagous insects, including those
   governing life history traits at the individual level, as well as those
   acting on population and community structure and dynamics. We detail how
   properties of host-infested plants determine parasitism behaviour,
   development (in the case of parasitoids) and nectar consumption by adult
   entomophagous insects. We detail how plants respond to and benefit from
   natural enemies attacking insect herbivores. We also illustrate how
   plant architecture, the vegetation communities and their climatic
   correlates can influence predator and parasitoid behaviour and
   populations. This chapter considers the biology and ecology of the
   interactions and mentions some implications for the biological control
   of plant pests.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Echinococcus is composed of eight generally recognized species

   review existing information on transmission routes and life cycles in
   different geographical contexts and - where available - include basic
   biological information of parasites and hosts (e.g., susceptibility of
   host species). While some Echinococcus spp. are transmitted in life
   cycles that involve predominantly domestic animals (e.g., dog -
   livestock cycles), others are wildlife parasites that do or do not
   interact with domestic transmission. In many cases, life cycle patterns
   of the same parasite species differ according to geography. Simple life
   cycles contrast with transmission patterns that are highly complex,
   involving multihost systems that may include both domestic and wild
   mammals. Wildlife transmission may be primary or secondary, i.e.,
   resulting from spillovers from domestic animals. For most of the species
   and regions, existing information does not yet permit a conclusive

Abstract = {{Although Drosophilidae and associated hymenopterous parasitoids have

   study investigated the seasonality of Drosophila, Scaptodrosophila and
   associated hymenopterous parasitoids in Canterbury by using traps baited
   with banana, orange, mushrooms, other fruits and vegetables and vinegar
   at two locations, New Brighton and Lincoln. From 176 sampling events,
   seven species of drosophilid were collected: Drosophila busckii; D.
   funebris; D. hydei; D. immigrans; D. pseudoobscura; D. simulans; and
   Scaptodrosophila enigma. Seven species of adult parasitoid wasps were
   also recorded in the traps: the braconids Dinotrema longworthi,
   Aphaereta aotea, Asobara tabida, Aspilota andyaustini; the ichneumonid
   Campoplex sp.; and two encyrtids, including Tachinaephagus
   zealandicus.The more abundant drosophilid species were found throughout
   the year, with fewer species occurring in the winter months
   (June-August). Parasitoids tended to be found more often in the warmer
   months, with only one specimen (of Aspilota andyaustini) collected
   between June and October. All seven species of drosophilids were
   obtained from traps with banana and mushroom baits. Mushroom proved
   valuable for obtaining parasitoids, with five species being recorded on
   this bait.Although the wasps were all captured along with adult
   Drosophila, it is believed only one species, Asobara tabida, is a
   confirmed drosophilid parasitoid. Further field study, on a wider

   provide additional information on the phenology, biogeography and

Title = {{Does rotational heather burning increase red grouse abundance and
   breeding success on moors in northern England?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Rotational burning of moorland vegetation is considered by grouse moor
   managers to create structurally diverse habitat that helps maximise red
   grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica (Lath.) abundance for shooting by
   increasing breeding success and adult survival. However, there is
   growing concern that increasing levels of burning, particularly on deep
   peat, are impacting upon upland ecosystems. We used linear mixed models
   to examine the influence of burning on heather Calluna vulgaris (L.)
   height and structure, and on grouse density and breeding success, at 36
   moors in northern England which practiced driven grouse shooting and
   employed full-time gamekeepers to burn heather, but also to control
   generalist predators of grouse and their parasitic nematode worms.
   Variation in heather height was positively associated with burning
   extent on moors and the relationship between heather height and burning
   was similar on moors of deep (blanket bog) and shallow peat (heath).
   Grouse pre-breeding density was not related to burning extent, but
   breeding success and post-breeding density were positively associated
   with extent of burning on moors. Relationships between grouse and
   burning were similar on heath and blanket bog. Higher grouse breeding
   success and post-breeding density were likely to be associated with a
   more varied vegetation structure following burning. Rotational burning
   is associated with higher grouse breeding success and post-breeding
   densities beneficial for driven grouse shooting. Thus a conflict may
   exist between rotational burning to benefit grouse and potential impacts
   of burning on ecosystem services such as carbon storage and flood
   protection. Potential benefits of burning for increasing grouse breeding
   success and post-breeding density need to be considered carefully
   against any likely impacts on ecosystem services, particularly in areas
   of blanket peat.}},

   parasitism of O. faccinii on the anuran's body. To this end, 1026
   specimens of T. miliaris from five important herpetological collections
   in Brazil were examined, 97 of which were parasitized by 433 larvae of
   O. faccinii. The geographical distribution of O. faccinii appears to be

   regarding the behaviour of the larvae and the absence of parasitizing
   nymphs and adults. Thirteen municipalities in the state of Rio de

   Santo and Bahia were added to the list of distribution of O. faccinii.
   No significant differences (p > 0.05) in parasitism were found among the
   categories of subadult, male and female. Twelve attachment sites were
   found for O. faccinii larvae, and the most frequently parasitized site
   on the body of T. miliaris was the inguinal region, followed by the
   lateral ventral and axillary regions. Parasitism by O. faccinii is

Abstract = {{The Asian toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Schneider, 1799), is
   widespread throughout tropical Asia and very abundant where it occurs.
   It was relatively recently introduced to Timor, the second largest
   island in the biogeographic region called Wallacea. Timor Island shows
   an exceptionally high level of endemismin a wide range of faunal groups
   and there are concerns that D. melanostictus may have a negative impact
   on this diversity, including vertebrates, through direct predation. To
   evaluate the impact the diet of D. melanostictus might have on the local
   fauna, gut contents of 83 preserved toad specimens from five habitat
   types in Timor-Leste, a country occupying the eastern half of Timor
   Island, were examined. We identified 5581 prey items, comprising the
   following animal groups: annelids; snails and slugs; spiders and
   harvestmen; woodlice; millipedes and centipedes; grasshoppers, crickets
   and earwigs; termites; thrips and true bugs; beetles; ants;
   hymenopterans other than ants; true flies; butterflies; unidentified
   insects; and insect larvae. Small eusocial insects (ants and termites)
   constituted the major part of the diet (61.6\% and 23.4\%,
   respectively). No vertebrate prey was recorded. Prey item composition
   did not differ between habitats. The wide prey spectrum well indicates
   that D. melanostictus is a generalist invertebrate feeder, as other
   studies, from regions where this species occurs naturally, have already
   shown. Although the Asian toad seems to not generally prey on
   vertebrates, vertebrate species that are morphologically similar to
   invertebrates in their overall appearance may be consumed. Hence, a
   negative effect on some taxa (e.g. blindsnakes) may be possible. We also
   present some limited data on intestinal parasites occurring in D.
   melanostictus.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{119}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The stimulation of immune responses is a common tool in invertebrate
   studies to examine the efficacy and the mechanisms of immunity. This
   stimulation is based on the injection of non-pathogenic particles into
   insects, as the particles will be detected by the immune system and will
   induce the production of immune effectors. We focus here on the
   stimulation of the melanization response in the mosquito Anopheles
   gambiae. The melanization response results in the encapsulation of
   foreign particles and parasites with a dark layer of melanin. To
   stimulate this response, mosquitoes are inoculated with beads in the
   thoracic cavity using microcapillary glass tubes. Then, after 24 hr, the
   mosquitoes are dissected to retrieve the beads. The degree of
   melanization of the bead is measured using image analysis software.
   Beads do not have the pathogenic effects of parasites, or their capacity
   to evade or suppress the immune response. These injections are a way to
   measure immune efficacy and the impact of immune stimulations on other
   life history traits, such as fecundity or longevity. It is not exactly
   the same as directly studying host-parasite interactions, but it is an
   interesting tool to study immunity and its evolutionary ecology.}},

   Beetle-fungus specificity is clade dependent and ranges from strict to

   common relationship with host trees is colonization of freshly dead
   tissues, but there are also parasites of living trees, vectors of
   pathogenic fungi, and beetles living in rotten trees with a wood-decay
   symbiont. Most of these strategies are driven by fungal metabolism
   whereas beetle ecology is evolutionarily more flexible. The ambrosia
   lifestyle facilitated a radiation of social strategies, from fungus
   thieves to eusocial species to communities assembled by attraction to
   fungal scent. Although over 95\% of the symbiotic pairs are economically
   harmless, there are also three types of pest damage: tree pathogen
   inoculation, mass accumulation on susceptible hosts, and structural

   basal bracts of females and among freshly open flowers on male
   inflorescences. Nectar was relatively dilute (11-18\%), and
   concentration and volume did not differ between male and female flowers.
   We found five plant species of different families as hosts, confirming
   that L. hypogaea is a generalist and suggesting interactions with the
   local plant community based on abundance and/or host quality. Besides a
   non quantified number of insect species, we recorded for the first time

Abstract = {{Infection avoidance behaviors are the first line of defense against
   pathogenic encounters. Behavioral plasticity in response to internal or
   external cues of infection can therefore generate potentially
   significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila
   melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behavior, and whether this
   behavior is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and
   by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined 2 measures of infection
   avoidance: (1) the motivation to seek out food sources in the presence
   of an infection risk and (2) the preference to land on a clean food
   source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no evidence
   for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones,
   previously exposed female flies showed lower motivation to pick a food
   source when presented with a risk of encountering DCV. We discuss the
   relevance of behavioral plasticity during foraging for host fitness and
   pathogen spread.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{573-588}},
Abstract = {{One of the unpleasant byproducts of urban living is municipal solid
   waste. Unfortunately, many urban areas cannot effectively manage their
   waste, which causes creation of illegal waste sites. We investigated
   communities of small mammals from 14 illegal waste sites in
   Mediterranean Slovenia and Croatia. Five species of the family Muridae
   were recorded: black rat (Rattus rattus), domestic mouse (Mus musculus),
   wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), striped field mouse (Apodemus
   agrarius), and yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Black rats
   and house mice, the two commensal species, were exclusively found or
   prevalent in larger waste sites, while the other three Apodemus species
   were most frequent in natural or seminatural habitats (> 90\%
   specimens). At large waste sites and in the human settlements, commensal
   species evidently outnumber the three native Apodemus species (< 25\% of
   specimens). Our results show that improper waste management drives the
   native rodents to local extinction and replacing them with invasive
   commensal species, thereby reducing biodiversity and ecosystem health.
   We conclude that higher rates of parasitism and infestation with
   different pathogens in waste sites, especially those in the close
   proximity of human settlements can raise the possibility of transferring
   the pathogens and parasites either to the people or their predators.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{192-203}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Testosterone mediates several key aspects of male reproduction, but
   maintaining high testosterone levels can reduce long-term survival. One
   of the proposed pathways by which testosterone can influence survival is
   through increased risk of parasite infection. The hormone has the
   potential to affect the transmission of sexually transmitted infections
   by promoting behaviours that increase sexual contact rates and/or by
   decreasing immune function.
   2. We hypothesized that males with high concentrations of testosterone
   would increase their chances of being infected with sexually transmitted
   bacteria, which would manifest as increased diversity of cloacal
   bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we measured circulating testosterone
   concentrations in breeding male rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia
   capensis) and collected cloacal swabs to quantify bacterial diversity
   using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
   3. There was a positive correlation between testosterone concentrations
   and the phylogenetic diversity of cloacal bacteria. In addition,
   individuals with high and medium testosterone concentrations had cloacal
   bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to those
   of low testosterone individuals. Finally, when considering bacterial
   taxa that are potential avian pathogens, we found that the relative
   abundance of Chlamydiae, a class of obligate intracellular parasites,
   was positively correlated with testosterone concentrations.
   4. Two non-exclusive explanations for these results are that
   testosterone affects behaviours that lead to increased sexual contacts
   and thus the exposure and acquisition of additional phylogenetically
   diverse bacteria, and/or that testosterone is altering the immune system
   or the cloacal environment, thus making it easier for bacteria to
   colonize. Either way, these data suggest that increased exposure to
   sexually transmitted pathogens in the form of cloacal bacteria could be
   a cost of maintaining high testosterone levels.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Parasites and pathogens can have an important effect on their host's
   thermal resistance. The impact of parasite infection on host
   physiological performances has traditionally been studied in controlled
   laboratory conditions, and much less is known about its actual effects
   in wild populations. Nonetheless, such knowledge is critical when
   assessing the effect of climate change on the future survival of the
   host.
   2. Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is a myxozoan endoparasite causing
   proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in salmonids. Infection and clinical
   symptoms of PKD are dependent on environmental temperature and PKD has
   become an emerging disease of primary importance for farmed and wild
   salmonids in the last decades. Despite important achievements in
   understanding PKD pathology in recent years, there are still crucial
   gaps in the knowledge of the disease ecology, notably in how the
   parasite affects host performance in the wild.
   3. We sampled juvenile (0+) brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the wild
   during early and late summer and assessed relative parasite load (DNA
   quantification with qPCR) and disease severity (kidney hyperplasia). We
   also measured haematocrit, leucocyte formula, aerobic scope and upper
   thermal tolerance in a field-physiology approach in order to better
   understand the relationships between PKD severity and host performance.
   By using wild-caught individuals and performing measurements directly on
   location, we aimed to gain insights into host physiology in a natural
   environment while avoiding biases caused by laboratory acclimation.
   4. We found that most physiopathological symptoms in the wild were
   strongly correlated with kidney hyperplasia, but more weakly linked to
   parasite load. Disease severity was positively correlated with anaemia
   and abundance of circulating thrombocytes, and negatively correlated
   with aerobic scope and thermal tolerance.
   5. Our results suggest that impaired aerobic performances and thermal
   tolerance in infected fish may potentially result in decreased host
   survival in the wild, especially in relation with predicted higher
   average summer temperatures and increased frequency of extreme events
   (summer heatwaves) in the context of global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The four species of Lennoaceae have strands of primary plus secondary

   fibers), lack rays within the vascular strands, and have markedly
   elliptical vessel-to-vessel pits without vestures. Lennoaceae have
   secondary xylem with short, wide vessel elements with thick walls,
   horizontally elongate elliptical pits, simple perforation plates much

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduced parasites threaten host populations around the world. For
   example, introduced parasitic nest flies (Philornis downsi) have
   contributed to the decline of several species of Darwin's finches in the
   Galapagos Islands. Introduced parasites are thought to have severe
   effects on native hosts because the hosts do not have effective defenses
   against such parasites and/or because introduced parasites have escaped
   the native enemies that keep their own populations in check. Studying
   effects of parasites on native hosts is an essential step in testing
   these causal hypotheses. We conducted a field experiment to assess the
   virulence of a native species of Philornis (Philornis trinitensis),
   which parasitizes birds on the island of Tobago. We manipulated flies in
   nests of black-faced grassquits (Tiaris bicolor), a close relative of
   Darwin's finches, as well as tropical mockingbirds (Mimus gilvus), a
   congener of the Galapagos mockingbird (Mimus parvulus). We predicted
   that P. trinitensis would be relatively avirulent because its native
   hosts in Tobago have had time to evolve effective defenses against it.
   We also noted the presence of parasitoids and other enemies of Philornis
   in Tobago nests. Surprisingly, effects of native P. trinitensis on
   Tobago birds were similar to the effects of introduced P. downsi on
   birds in the Galapagos. Flies reduced the reproductive success of
   grassquits, but not mockingbirds, which are also relatively unaffected
   by Philornis in the Galapagos. Thus, native Philornis flies are not less
   virulent than introduced flies. The prevalence of Philornis in Tobago
   was lower than the prevalence of Philornis in the Galapagos. Presumed
   enemies of Philornis (parasitoid wasps and ants) were relatively common
   in nests of birds in Tobago, but largely absent from nests in the
   Galapagos. We suggest that introduced P. downsi in the Galapagos is
   widespread, not because hosts lack defenses, but because it has left its
   enemies behind.}},

   remnant wild Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus) population,
   an endangered species found in the southwestern United States.
   Infections with multiple parasites on the gills were observed and there
   was spatio-temporal variation in parasite communities and patterns of
   infection among individuals. Despite its highly endangered status and
   chronically low genetic effective size, Rio Grande silvery minnow had
   high allelic diversity at MHC class II with more alleles recognized at

   significant associations between specific parasites and MHC alleles
   against a backdrop of generalist parasite prevalence. We also found that
   individuals with higher individual neutral heterozygosity and higher
   amino acid divergence between MHC alleles had lower parasite abundance

   fluctuating selection imposed by spatio-temporal variation in pathogen
   communities and divergent allele advantage in maintenance of high MHC

Abstract = {{Despite the number of virulent pathogens that are projected to benefit

Title = {{Implications of Changing Temperatures on the Growth, Fecundity and

   Review}},

Abstract = {{Climate change has been predicted to increase the global mean
   temperature and to alter the ecological interactions among organisms.
   These changes may play critical roles in influencing the life history
   traits of the intermediate hosts (IHs). This review focused on studies
   and disease models that evaluate the potential effect of temperature
   rise on the ecology of IH snails and the development of parasites within
   them. The main focus was on IH snails of schistosome parasites that
   cause schistosomiasis in humans. A literature search was conducted on
   Google Scholar, EBSCOhost and PubMed databases using predefined medical
   subject heading terms, Boolean operators and truncation symbols in
   combinations with direct key words. The final synthesis included
   nineteen published articles. The studies reviewed indicated that
   temperature rise may alter the distribution, optimal conditions for
   breeding, growth and survival of IH snails which may eventually increase
   the spread and/or transmission of schistosomiasis. The literature also
   confirmed that the life history traits of IH snails and their
   interaction with the schistosome parasites are affected by temperature
   and hence a change in climate may have profound outcomes on the
   population size of snails, parasite density and disease epidemiology. We
   concluded that understanding the impact of temperature on the growth,
   fecundity and survival of IH snails may broaden the knowledge on the
   possible effects of climate change and hence inform schistosomiasis
   control programmes.}},

Title = {{Planning host exploitation through prospecting visits by parasitic
   cowbirds}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We studied visits to potential host nests by two avian brood parasites,
   the host generalist shiny cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis, and the host
   specialist screaming cowbird, Molothrus rufoaxillaris, in the periods
   preceding and overlapping the laying period of their hosts. Our goal was
   to examine the hypothesis that during prelaying visits, cowbird females
   form a dynamic memory library of laying opportunities, which they deploy
   to target suitable nests at a later predawn period. We recorded presence
   of radio-tagged females within a fixed area around nests of
   chalked-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus (a common host of shiny
   cowbirds), and baywings, Agelaioides badius (the main host of screaming
   cowbirds), using proximity data loggers placed at nests during
   prelaying, laying and early incubation. Our data confirmed that females
   of both species visit potential host nests prior to laying and that
   parasitic events occurred before dawn, earlier in screaming than shiny
   cow-birds but with little chance of host nests having been discovered on
   the laying day. There were interesting species differences: visits were
   less frequent in shiny than screaming cowbirds and the former rarely
   returned after laying, while screaming cowbirds visited nests repeatedly
   after laying and occasionally showed repeat parasitism. The higher
   frequency of revisiting by screaming cowbirds to baywing nests is
   consistent with the uncommonly long and variable baywing prelaying
   period, and the incidence of repeat parasitism may reflect low
   availability of baywing nests and greater flexibility of its parental
   care potential thanks to it being a social breeder.
   Significance statement
   Avian brood parasites synchronize their laying with that of their hosts,
   as this reduces egg rejection and optimizes hatching time. They also
   avoid parasitizing nests repeatedly, thus preventing harm to their own
   previously laid eggs and competition among their offspring. Further,
   they lay at dawn, so that location of target nests must be known from
   previous days' exploration. It has been argued that these adaptations
   must depend on memory for the location and status of host nests within
   their home range, a memory feat known as `bookkeeping'. We study nest
   prospecting in a host specialist and a host generalist parasitic
   cowbird, using a combination of proximity radio tracking and video
   recordings. Our results confirm the prospecting hypothesis, report
   previously unknown interspecies differences and illustrate how cognitive
   adaptations can be studied in the context of field behavioural ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species can cause indirect effects on native biota by modifying

   This study investigated the role of the invasive Pacific oyster
   (Crassostrea gigas) in potential spillover (co-introduced parasites
   infect native hosts) and spillback (native or established parasites
   infect invasive hosts and re-infect native hosts) scenarios of recently
   introduced (Mytilicola orientalis) and previously established
   (Mytilicola intestinalis) marine parasitic copepods in two regions in
   northern Europe, the Dutch Delta and the Wadden Sea. By examining 3416
   individuals of 11 potential host species from sympatric host
   populations, we found that the recently introduced parasite M.
   orientalis does not only infect its principal host, the invasive Pacific
   oyster (prevalence at infected sites 2-43 \%, mean intensity 4.1 +/- 0.6
   SE), but also native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis; 3-63 \%, 2.1 +/-
   0.2), common cockles (Cerastoderma edule; 2-13 \%, 1.2 +/- 0.3) and
   Baltic tellins (Macoma balthica; 6-7 \%, 1.0 +/- 0), confirming a
   spillover effect. Spillback effects were not observed as the previously
   established M. intestinalis was exclusively found in blue mussels
   (prevalence at infected locations 3-72 \%, mean intensity 2.4 +/- 0.3
   SE). The high frequency of M. orientalis spillover, in particular to
   native mussels, suggests that Pacific oysters may cause strong
   parasite-mediated indirect impacts on native bivalve populations.}},

Abstract = {{Hosts can utilize different types of defense against the effects of
   parasitism, including avoidance, resistance, and tolerance. Typically,
   there is tremendous heterogeneity among hosts in these defense
   mechanisms that may be rooted in the costs associated with defense and
   lead to trade-offs with other life-history traits. Trade-offs may also
   exist between the defense mechanisms, but the relationships between
   avoidance, resistance, and tolerance have rarely been studied. Here, we
   assessed these three defense traits under common garden conditions in a
   natural host-parasite system, the trematode eye-fluke Diplostomum
   pseudospathaceum and its second intermediate fish host. We looked at
   host individuals originating from four genetically distinct populations
   of two closely related salmonid species (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar
   and sea trout, Salmo trutta trutta) to estimate the magnitude of
   variation in these defense traits and the relationships among them. We
   show species-specific variation in resistance and tolerance and
   population-specific variation in resistance. Further, we demonstrate
   evidence for a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. Our results
   suggest that the variation in host defense can at least partly result
   from a compromise between different interacting defense traits, the
   relative importance of which is likely to be shaped by environmental
   components. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering
   different components of the host defense system when making predictions
   on the outcome of host-parasite interactions.}},

Pages = {{10-20}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Heritable microbes represent an important component of the biology,
   ecology and evolution of many plants, animals and fungi, acting as both
   parasites and partners. In this review, we examine how heritable
   symbiont-host interactions may alter host thermal tolerance, and how the
   dynamics of these interactions may more generally be altered by thermal
   environment. Obligate symbionts, those required by their host, are
   considered to represent a thermally sensitive weak point for their host,
   associated with accumulation of deleterious mutations. As such, these
   symbionts may represent an important determinant of host thermal
   envelope and spatial distribution. We then examine the varied
   relationship between thermal environment and the frequency of
   facultative symbionts that provide ecologically contingent benefits or
   act as parasites. We note that some facultative symbionts directly alter
   host thermotolerance. We outline how thermal environment will alter the
   benefits/costs of infection more widely, and additionally modulate
   vertical transmission efficiency. Multiple patterns are observed, with
   symbionts being cold sensitive in some species and heat sensitive in
   others, with varying and non-coincident thresholds at which phenotype
   and transmission are ablated. Nevertheless, it is clear that studies
   aiming to predict ecological and evolutionary dynamics of symbiont-host
   interactions need to examine the interaction across a range of thermal
   environments. Finally, we discuss the importance of thermal sensitivity
   in predicting the success/failure of symbionts to spread into novel
   species following natural/engineered introduction.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transgenerational effects, whereby the environment experienced by a
   parent leads to an altered offspring phenotype, have now been described
   in a variety of taxa. In invertebrates, much of the research on these
   effects has concentrated on the role of parental exposure to pathogens
   or immune elicitors in determining offspring immune investment or
   disease resistance. To date, however, studies of transgenerational
   effects in invertebrates have generally been restricted to single
   infections or immune elicitors in ideal laboratory environments. Animals
   in field situations will commonly experience sub-optimal environments
   and co-infection by multiple species of parasites and pathogens, leading
   to increased relative costs of immune investment and changing fitness
   benefits from offspring responses to the parental environment. Here we
   investigate a more ecologically realistic scenario involving both
   multiple infections and resource limitation, using the Indian meal moth
   Plodia interpunctella as a model host, challenged with the
   entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and fungus Beauveria
   bassiana. Mothers were exposed to low doses of one or both pathogens, or
   a control. Offspring from each family were reared on either good-or
   poor-quality food and then exposed to one or both pathogens. Maternal
   exposure to pathogens led to reduced pathogen resistance in offspring,
   depending on the combination of maternal and offspring pathogen-specific
   infections and resource limitation in the offspring generation. Much
   research to date has focussed on trans-generational immune priming, in
   which parental exposure to pathogens or immune elicitors leads to
   upregulated immune reactivity in their offspring. The lack of any such
   effects in our system suggests that the production of less resistant
   offspring following parental exposure to pathogens might be an important
   alternative, driven by costs of resistance rather than adaptive
   benefits.}},

Pages = {{52-64}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Parasite communities of aquatic macroinvertebrates have so far rarely
   been studied, even if these host organisms are of high relevance for the
   ecology of freshwater systems and their parasites likely affect the host
   populations and communities. Therefore, this study addresses this
   `hidden diversity' in aquatic arthropods of a stream ecosystem in North
   Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
   2. Samples of benthic organisms were taken, and the most abundant host
   species of major invertebrate groups (amphipods and larvae of
   chironomids, beetles, caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies) were tested by
   PCR for different parasite taxa {[}microsporidians, acanthocephalans
   (only amphipods), trematodes, nematodes]. Furthermore, the possible link
   between prevalence and host feeding type was investigated for each
   parasite group using a newly developed ` feeding type score'.
   3. In total, 10 species of aquatic insect larvae and two amphipods of
   the genus Gammarus spp. were tested and 16 different isolates of
   microsporidians, three acanthocephalan species, six species of
   trematodes and one nematode were found. Microsporidians were present in
   all host species with prevalences ranging from 20 to 100\%. Only one
   presumably specific host-microsporidian association was found for the
   mayfly Ephemera danica and three isolates were detected exclusively in
   amphipods. Three acanthocephalan species were detected in the amphipods
   with prevalences of up to 5.3\%. All tested host species were infected
   with trematodes (prevalences 25-100\%), except the caddisfly Sericostoma
   sp. Nematodes were detected in five host species with prevalences
   ranging from 14 to 80\%. For several positive samples, no sequencing
   result could be obtained, especially for trematodes and nematodes,
   therefore, the actual parasite diversity might be even higher.
   4. Active filter feeding showed the highest feeding type prevalence
   score for microsporidia and nematodes, and passive filter feeders for
   trematodes, but these results have to be interpreted cautiously as only
   one active and one passive filter feeder species each were present in
   the sample.
   5. The impressive number of 26 parasite species (12 microsporidians and
   10 helminths) were detected in 12 host species, mostly with surprisingly
   high prevalences. These results illustrate the `hidden diversity' in
   aquatic ecosystems and highlight the importance of parasites for aquatic
   ecological research and the need for studies on the effects of mixed
   parasite infections on the host populations and communities.}},

   insect seed predators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{136-146}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Identification of the mechanisms enabling stable coexistence of
   species with similar resource requirements is a central challenge in
   ecology. Such coexistence can be facilitated by species at higher
   trophic levels through complex multi-trophic interactions, a mechanism
   that could be compromised by ongoing defaunation.
   2. We investigated cascading effects of defaunation on Pachymerus cardo
   and Speciomerus giganteus, the specialized insect seed predators of the
   Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea, testing the hypothesis that
   vertebrate frugivores and granivores facilitate their coexistence.
   3. Laboratory experiments showed that the two seed parasitoid species
   differed strongly in their reproductive ecology. Pachymerus produced
   many small eggs that it deposited exclusively on the fruit exocarp
   (exterior). Speciomerus produced few large eggs that it deposited
   exclusively on the endocarp, which is normally exposed only after a
   vertebrate handles the fruit. When eggs of the two species were
   deposited on the same fruit, Pachymerus triumphed only when it had a
   long head start, and the loser always succumbed to intraguild predation.
   4. We collected field data on the fates of 6569 Attalea seeds across
   sites in central Panama with contrasting degrees of defaunation and wide
   variation in the abundance of vertebrate frugivores and granivores.
   Speciomerus dominated where vertebrate communities were intact, whereas
   Pachymerus dominated in defaunated sites. Variation in the relative
   abundance of Speciomerus across all 84 sampling sites was strongly
   positively related to the proportion of seeds attacked by rodents, an
   indicator of local vertebrate abundance.
   5. Synthesis. We show that two species of insect seed predators relying
   on the same host plant species are niche differentiated in their
   reproductive strategies such that one species has the advantage when
   fruits are handled promptly by vertebrates and the other when they are
   not. Defaunation disrupts this mediating influence of vertebrates and
   strongly favours one species at the expense of the other, providing a
   case study of the cascading effects of defaunation and its potential to
   disrupt coexistence of non-target species, including the hyperdiverse
   phytophagous insects of tropical forests.}},
